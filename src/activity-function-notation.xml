        <introduction>
            <p>After completing this activity you will be able to:</p>
        </introduction>
        <ol>

                <p>Interpret the meaning of function notation.</p>

    </objectives>

    <introduction>
        <p>In this activity we define a function and develop an understanding of function notation by comparing statements we already understand in English to equivalent statements written in <q>math</q> language.</p>

        <p>The prerequisites for this lesson are knowing how to read a graph or a table of values and how to use a formula to make a calculation.</p>
    </introduction>

    <subsection>
        <title>What is a Function?</title>

        <p>The mathematical concept of a function can be extremely complicated. It took thousands of years to come up with it, define it and formalize it. For example, just look at this definition from <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)">Wikipedia</url> (do not spend too much time on it.)</p>
        <p>You could spend your whole life learning about what a function is and never get to the rest of this book! For this reason we will keep things simple and informal in order to attain a quick and accessible understanding of topics, including functions. Students continuing in mathematics will add to their knowledge of functions as needed and as part of a life-long process.</p>

        <p>Start by remembering this: one input, one output.</p>

        <p>A <term>function</term><idx><h>function</h></idx> is a rule that takes a piece of <q>usable</q> information that you choose (input) and gives you some kind of result (output).  By <q>usable</q> we mean information that has meaning for the function.</p>
        <p>Think of a function as a sort of machine.  Using some input, the machine does something to the input and then out pops a result.  In this course our inputs will be mostly numbers and the process will yield numbers as results.</p>
         <exercise xml:id="webwork-function-temperature-converter">
            <introduction><p>A simple example of a function is a temperature converter. It converts a temperature from degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius.</p>
            <p>The function is the rule or process used to convert from one unit of temperature to the other.</p>

                <statement>
                  <p>Our function is a graph, but it could have been a table of values or a formula.</p>
                  <p>The graph illustrates that the temperature in degrees Celsius is a <term>function</term> of the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
                    <p>The temperature in degrees Fahrenheit, <m>F</m>, is the input while the temperature in degrees Celsius, <m>C</m>, is the output.</p>
                    <sidebyside>
                        <image pg-name="$gr[0]" />
                    </sidebyside>
                    <p>Use the graph to estimate your answers below:<ol>
                        <li>
                            <p>The temperature of <m>77</m> degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius</p>

                            <p>What temperature in Fahrenheit is the same as <m>-22</m> degrees Celsius? (Type your answer as <q><m>F=\ldots</m></q>.)</p>
                            <p><var name="$solve" width="15" /></p>
                        </li>
                    </ol></p>
                </statement>
                <hint>
                  <p><ol>
                    <li><p>Locate the input value of <m>77</m> degrees Fahrenheit along the horizontal axis, and find the point on the graph directly above this input value. What is the output value when the input is <m>77</m>?</p></li>
                    <li><p>Locate the output value of <m>-22</m> degrees Celsius along the vertical axis, and find the point on the graph directly to the left of this output value. What is the input value which gives the output of <m>-22</m>?</p></li>
                  </ol></p>
                </hint>
                <solution>
                    <p>To graphically find these answers, visualize arrows and guidelines on the graph. To find the Celsius equivalent of <m>77</m> degrees Fahrenheit, recognize that <m>77</m> is an input value, and so you must identify it on the horizontal axis. From there, move up, then left to the vertical axis, where you land at about <m>25</m> degrees Celsius. So <m>77 \text{degrees Fahrenheit} \approx25 \text{degrees Celsius}</m>.</p>

                    <sidebyside>
                        <image pg-name="$gr[1]" />
                    </sidebyside>

                    <p>A similar process in reverse is used to determine the Fahrenheit temperature equivalent of <m>-22</m> degrees Celsius. Recognize that <m>-22</m> is an output, and so you must identify it on the vertical axis. From there, move left, then up to the horizontal axis, where you land at about <m>-8</m> degrees Fahrenheit. So the answer is <m>F\approx-8</m>.</p>
                </solution>
            </webwork>
        </exercise>
        <p>This brings up some good questions:</p>
        <p><ul>
              <li><p>How do we communicate that we have a function? There has to be a simple or quick way to communicate we have a function.</p></li>
              <li><p>What kinds of inputs can the function use? The temperature function in the previous exercise could only accept temperatures between <m>-60</m> and <m>110</m> degrees Fahrenheit.  The input of <m>150</m> degrees <m>F</m> is not usable because it is not available to choose.</p></li>
              <li><p>What are the possible output temperatures in degrees Celsius?  Is any temperature possible or is there a window of reasonable temperature expectations?</p></li>
              <li><p>How are the two temperature units related? If you increase degrees F, does the temperature in degrees <m>C</m> also increase?</p></li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        <p>We start with notation. We don't want to keep writing the word, F U N C T I O N, all the time. That's just way too many letters.</p>

    <subsection>
        <title>Math as a Language</title>

        <p>Math is just another language. We use it to communicate measurements, changes in value and how things are related to or affect one another. Almost everything you say or describe in Math, you can say or describe in English.</p>

        <p>In this next exercise we learn to communicate the position of a train as time passes and develop the notation to express where the train is at different times. We will assume that this train runs on time, every day and the conditions every day are the same. You know, an alternate universe called <q>example land</q>.</p>

        <exercise>
            <webwork seed="1">
                <setup>
                    <pg-code>
                        $time = Real(random(2,7,1));
                        if($envir{problemSeed}==1){$time=2;};
                        $position = Real(40*exp(2.6*($time-2))/(1+exp(2.6*($time-2)))+10);
                        $units = PopUp(["?", "miles", "hours", "miles per hour", "hours per mile"], "miles");
                    </pg-code>
                </setup>
                <statement>
                    <p>Consider the graph below.</p>

                    <p>The dot on the graph represents the position of a train at a particular time. The cross-hairs represent the time.</p>

                    <p>Adjust the time by sliding cross-hairs left and right.  Notice that the train's distance, in miles, from downtown depends on the time, in hours, after <m>8</m> <init>a.m.</init></p>

                    <p>[@MODES(HTML=&gt;'&lt;iframe scrolling="no" src="https://www.geogebra.org/material/iframe/id/D4s2v4ft/width/450/height/459/border/888888/rc/false/ai/false/sdz/false/smb/false/stb/false/stbh/true/ld/false/sri/false/at/auto" width="450px" height="459px" style="border:0px;"&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;', TeX =&gt;"A GeoGebra applet.");@]*</p>

                    <p>How far from downtown is the train <m><var name="$time" /></m> hours after <m>8</m> <init>a.m.</init>?</p>

                    <p><var name="$position" width="5" /> <var name="$units" form="popup" /></p>

                    <p>Without knowing anything about function notation, you can still use a language you already know, English, to describe information about the train.</p>

                    <p>For instance:<ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>The train can only be in one place at any particular time.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>As time passes the train gets farther from downtown.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>The speed of the train changes during its trip.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul></p>

                    <p>There are also some characteristics of the graph itself you can also describe in English:<ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>The graph rises as we read it from left to right.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Sometimes the graph is curved upwards.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Sometimes the graph curves downwards.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Some parts of the graph are steeper than others.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul></p>
                </statement>
            </webwork>
        </exercise>

        <p>In English you can communicate information about time and position in a simple sentence like</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p><m>2</m> hours after <m>8</m> <init>a.m.</init> the train is <m>30</m> miles from downtown.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Here is what that same sentence looks like in Spanish.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p><m>2</m> horas despues de las 8 de la mañana el tren esta 30 millas lejos del centro.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Here is what that same sentence could look like in <q>math</q>.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p><m>f(2) = 30</m></p>
        </blockquote>

    <subsection>
        <title>The Grammar of Function Notation</title>

        <p>The math <q>sentence</q> above is actually an equation and it uses <term>function notation</term><idx><h>function</h><h>notation</h></idx><idx><h>notation</h><h>for functions</h></idx> to express the information about the train's position at a particular time.</p>

        <p>In math we don't really have subjects or verbs or objects. Instead we have input values (numbers) and we have output values. The function is the <q>machine</q> or the rule that tells us how to use the input to make an output.</p>

        <p><idx><h>variable</h></idx><term>Variables</term> are used to represent values we don't know or that may change. For a function, the input is called the <term>independent variable</term>, and the output is called the <term>dependent variable</term>. This is because the output depends on the input.</p>

        <p>The distance from downtown is constantly changing with time, so we can let the dependent variable <m>D</m> represent the <q>Train's distance in miles from downtown</q>. Similarly, we can use the independent variable <m>t</m> to represent the <q>number of hours after <m>8</m> <init>a.m.</init></q>.</p>

        <p>Typically, we use variables that have something to do with the context of the problem, but sometimes we generalize an expression or equation with <m>x</m>'s and <m>y's</m> when we have nothing specific in mind.</p>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>Variables have units</title>
                <p>If the variables represent actual things or events, we must define them to include the <term>units</term><idx><h>units</h></idx> we used to measure the event. This allows us to extract meaning from the values or expressions.</p>
                <p>If you know Spanish you can <em>interpret</em> the meaning of a Spanish article you read by translating it into English.  Likewise, if you know <q>math</q>, you can interpret the meaning of function notation by translating it into English, provided you know what the variables in the notation mean or what they are measuring.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>If <m>D</m> represents distance, you must define the units in which the distance is measured: miles, inches, centimeters, light years, etc.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>If <m>t</m> represents time, will it be measured with units of seconds, hours or years?</p>
                </blockquote>
        </paragraphs>
        <p>Since the position of the train depends on the amount of time that has passed, we say <q>the distance depends on time</q>.  More specifically, we say that the distance of the train from downtown is a <term>function of time</term>.</p>

        <p>Function notation allows us to communicate that distance is a function of time by simply writing <m>D = f(t)</m>. The notation <m>f(t)</m> is read as, <q><m>f</m> of <m>t</m></q>.</p>
        <p>Remember <m>t</m> is a value.  The function uses <m>t</m> to create the value <m>D</m>.</p>
        <p>Also, don't confuse the notation with multiplication! The expression <m>f(t)</m> does <alert>not</alert> mean <m>f</m> times <m>t</m>.</p>

        <note>
          <p>The word <q>function</q> usually refers to the actual <em>rule</em> which turns the input into the output. Sometimes, however, we will use it to describe the output of the relationship.</p>

        <p>Function notation like <m>f(t)</m> or <m>f(x)</m> or <m>f(\text{anything})</m> implies there is some kind of relation, some kind of rule, that takes a piece of information and returns a response or result. The format of function notation works on the basic principle of input and output and we often use the notation when we refer to things we don't yet know.</p>

        <p>For instance, if you work as a health assistant, you probably earn some hourly salary and you probably work some number of hours each week.  I have no idea how many hours a week you work and no idea how much you earn.  But I do know your weekly salary is related to the number of hours you work. In fact, your weekly salary is a function of the number of hours you work.</p>
        <p>If <m>t</m> is the number of hours you work and <m>S</m> is your weekly salary, I can use function notation to say <m>S = f(t)</m>, where <m>f</m> is the function, the instructions, that calculates your weekly salary. If you work <m>12</m> hours, then <m>t = 12</m>, so <m>f(12)</m> is your weekly salary for working <m>12</m> hours.</p>
        <p>Notice I still don't know what the salary actually is, but I can use function notation to talk about it. The expression <m>f(12)</m> literally means, <q>whatever you earn when you work <m>12</m> hours.</q></p>

        <p>In our train example we chose some input, a time, and the function gave us an output of distance.  The notation tells the reader what the input is by showing it in the parentheses:<me>f(\text{input}) = \mathit{output}</me> The function notation <m>f(0)</m> is telling us the input is <m>0</m>.  That means, <q><m>0</m> hours after <m>8</m> <init>a.m.</init></q> In other words, it's <m>8</m> <init>a.m.</init></p>

        <p>On the other hand, <m>f(0)</m> represents an output. It is <q>the train's distance from downtown, <m>0</m> hours after <m>8</m> <init>a.m.</init></q> But we don't know what that distance actually is yet. In this case, the notation <m>f(0)</m> means <q>Whatever the distance is at t = 0</q>.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, the input and output create an <term>ordered pair</term><idx><h>ordered pair</h></idx> <m>(0, f(0))</m>.  On a graph the ordered pair is a <term>point</term><idx><h>point</h></idx>.</p>

        <title>How to Determine if a Relation is a Function or Not</title>
        <p>When two or more variables are related to each other, the formula or rule that relates them is called a <term>relation</term>. For people, there is a relation between age and height. You can make ordered pairs of <m>(\text{age}, \text{height})</m> for different people and plot the points on a graph. You might even find a formula that predicts height based on age (or vice versa?)</p>
        <p>In every relation you have encountered so far in this chapter, each input gives you only one output. For the train example we saw earlier, we had the function <m>D = f(t)</m>. At any given time, like <m>t = 10</m>, the train can only be in one place, <m>f(10)</m>. It's not possible for the train to be in two or more places at the same time.</p>
        <p>Also, notice that each input has its own unique output. Every day at <m>t = 10</m>, the train is always in the same place: <m>f(10) = 30</m> (it's a very dependable train). These two conditions make the relation a function. Position is a function of time.</p>
        <p>But not all relations are functions. Just because two things are related does not mean one is a function of the other.</p>
        <p>Twice each day, the train is <m>30</m> miles away from downtown <mdash /> once in the morning on its way out, then later in the afternoon on the way back into town. If we choose position as input and time as output, we realize that the input <m>D = 30</m> gives us two answers: one time in the morning and another in the afternoon.  Thus time is not a function of position. All we have is a relation.</p>

        <p>Given a graph, draw a vertical line through any place on the graph.

        <p>In general when the inputs and outputs are nothing in particular, we use <m>x</m> as input and <m>y</m> as output so that <m>y = f(x)</m>.  We use <q><m>x</m></q> as a placeholder for the actual input value, while <q><m>y</m></q> is a placeholder for whatever the output value will be. The <m>x</m> basically says, <q>When you get the input, put it here</q> in all the places where the <m>x</m> is found.</p>

        <p>Consider the function <m>f(x) = 50x + 10</m>.  The function has no context (no story), so we won't bother using units for either <m>x</m> or <m>y</m>.</p>

        <p>If <m>x = 1</m>, then we can evaluate <m>f(1)</m>  by replacing the <m>x</m> in the formula with a <m>1</m>. Literally, <m>f(1)</m> means <q>what you get when you put <m>1</m> in the place of <m>x</m></q>.</p>
        <p>Similarly, if you change the input to <m>x = 2</m>, then you can evaluate the expression <m>f(2)</m>, which is <q>what you get when you put <m>2</m> in the place of <m>x</m></q>.</p>

        <title>The Secret to Evaluating Anything (The <q>Blank</q> Method)</title>

        <p>Function notation is a way to tell the reader information about the input and how to use it to generate an output. Again, the way it works is: <me>f(\text{input})=\text{output}</me> Whatever is in the parenthesis is the input.</p>

        <p>The input can be a simple number like <m>2</m> or <m>-4</m>, or it can be a complicated expression like <m>x^2 - x</m>.</p>

        <p>Your success in this course is almost entirely dependent on your understanding of this simple concept: <em>The <q>blank</q> method.</em></p>

        <p>When you see a formula like <m>f(x) = x^2 - x</m>. It means this:<me>f(\text{blank}) = (\text{blank})^2 - (\text{blank})</me></p>

        <p>At least, that's the way formulas really work.</p>

        <p>Using this function as an example, <m>f(5)</m> means <q>The formula with a <m>5</m> in it</q>. Literally, it means place number <m>5</m> in all the blanks.</p>

        <p>The beauty of this is that it does <em>not</em> matter what you put into the formula (as long as the formula can handle it, which we will get into later) <mdash /> the formula does the same thing every time.</p>

        <p>For the function <m>f(x) = x^2 - x</m>, you can put <m>5</m> into the formula and get the output: <md>
        <mrow>f(5) \amp= 5^2 - 5</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp= 20</mrow></md></p>
        <p>Or, you can put something complicated like <m>\frac{x^2}{x^2 + 1}</m> into the formula, which would look like this: <me>f\mathopen{}\left(\frac{x^2}{x^2 + 1}\right)\mathclose{} = \mathopen{}\left(\frac{x^2}{x^2 + 1}\right)^2\mathclose{} - \mathopen{}\left(\frac{x^2}{x^2 + 1}\right)\mathclose{}</me></p>

        <p>Simplifying this expression is another matter.</p>

        <p>What if the output, the result, is already known and we want to know all the inputs that give us this result?  This is called <term>solve</term><idx><h>solve</h></idx>.</p>
        <p>If you live in Oregon in the winter, you might ask, <q>What time will the temperature outside be <m>37</m> degrees Fahrenheit?</q> Typically there might be two answers to this question, one time in the morning and another time in the afternoon.</p>
        <p>You could answer the question with actual times if you had a <em>time <init>vs.</init> temperature</em> graph, or a formula, or a table of times and temperatures.</p>
        <p>Solving means to work backward from a known <em>output</em> value, in order to determine all the inputs that give us the desired output.</p>
        <p>Suppose we want the output of a function to be <m>y =0</m>. Therefore, we must find all the input values of <m>x</m> that give us that result. There may not be any, but there could be one, several or even infinite possible inputs that give <m>y = 0</m> as the output.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>What input makes the output equal to <m>0</m>?</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>There would be three answers:<me>x = - 4 , -1\text{ or }2</me></p>
        <p>All of these values of <m>x</m> give us the same result of <m>y = 0</m>.</p>
        <p>In math we could ask the same question, but it comes out as a command:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>Solve <m>f(x) = 0</m></p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>In other words, <q>Find the input that gives you a particular result</q>. In our case, the result we want is an output value of <m>0</m>. There are still three answers to the question and each answer is called a <q>solution</q>.</p>
        <p>The statement:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>Solve <m>f(x) = 0</m></p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>has three solutions:  <me>x = -4, -1 \text{ or }2</me></p>

        <p>If we look at functions graphically, the math sentence</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Solve the equation <m>f(x) = K</m></p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>where <m>K</m> is some number, means to <q>find all the <m>x</m>-values where the graph of the function reaches a height of <m>K</m> units.</q> This equation may have zero, one, several, or even infinite solutions.</p>
        <p>Even equations where a formula equals another formula can be solved graphically. Consider <me>2^x + 0.025 = 0.55x - 0.3</me>To solve graphically, make a graph on your graphing calculator, then find the <m>x</m> values where the graphs have the same output (height). In other words, find where the graphs intersect.</p>

                    <p>The graphs of two functions are shown. One is linear: <me>y = 0.55x - 0.3</me> and the other is called <em>exponential</em>: <me>f(x)=2^x + 0.025</me> Solving the equation <me>2^x + 0.025 = 0.55x -0.3</me> would not be possible using our current algebra techniques. But in English, solving the equation means to find where the functions intersect. That we can do quite easily using graphs.</p>

        <p>If we have a formula for a function, we may also solve for a particular input.</p>
        <example>
          <statement>
            <p>Consider the function <m>h(x) = 4x + 10</m>, answering the questions that follow.</p>
            <p><ol label="a">
              <li><p>Solve <m>h(x) = 0</m></p></li>
              <li><p>Solve <m>h(x) = 10</m></p></li>
              <li><p>Evaluate <m>h(0)</m></p></li>
            </ol></p>
          </statement>
          <answer>
            <p>We <em>solve</em> the equation <m>h(x) = 0</m> by setting the output of the function <m>h</m> equal to zero. This is written:<me>4x + 10 = 0</me></p>
            <p>Solving this equation gives the solution: <m>x = -2.5</m></p>
          </answer>
          <answer>
            <p>Solving <m>h(x) = 10</m> works similarly:<md>
              <mrow>4x + 10 \amp= 10</mrow>
              <mrow>4x \amp= 0</mrow>
              <mrow>x \amp= 0</mrow></md>
            </p>
          </answer>
          <answer>
            <p><m>h(0) = 4(0) + 10 = 0</m></p>
            <p>Notice that we just solved for this value in the previous problem. That is, we already found that <m>x = 0</m> is the input that gives <m>10</m> as the output.</p>
