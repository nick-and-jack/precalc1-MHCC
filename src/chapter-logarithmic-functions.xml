      <title>A Tool for Solving Exponential Equations</title>
      <p>
        Logarithms are functions that,
        among other things, can be used to solve exponential equations.
        If we have an exponential equation in which the variable is in the exponent,
        we use logarithms to isolate the variable.
      </p>

      <p>
        By definition, a logarithm is an exponent.
        In the exponential equation
        <me>
          b^{y}=x
        </me>
        The exponent <m>y</m> is the logarithm so
        <me>
          y=\log_{b}(x)
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        There are at least three useful rules about logarithms:
      </p>

      <p>
        The first rule is often used to
        <q>bring the exponent down</q>
        <mdash /> after applying the logarithm,
        the exponent becomes a factor.
      </p>

      <p>
        The nest two rules are sometimes used to combine two terms involving logarithms,
        or to split one term into two.
      </p>

      <assemblage>
        <p>
          <ol label="1">
            <li xml:id="item-logarithm-of-power-rule">

              <p>
                <m>\log_{b}(N^{x})=x \log_{b}(N)</m>
              </p>
            </li>

            <li xml:id="item-logarithm-of-product-rule">

              <p>
                <m>\log_{b}(AB)=\log_{b}(A)+\log_{b}(B)</m>
              </p>
            </li>

            <li xml:id="item-logarithm-of-quotient-rule">

              <p>
                <m>\log_{b}\mathopen{}\left(\frac{A}{B}\right)\mathclose{}=\log_{b}(A)-\log_{b}(B)</m>
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </assemblage>

      <p>
        The first rule is perhaps the most useful at this level.
      </p>

      <p>
        I used to have a pocket knife with <m>10</m> different tools folded into it,
        but I mostly used only one.
        <xref ref="item-logarithm-of-power-rule">Rule</xref> is that tool.
        It allows us to take an exponential expression and
        <q>bring down the exponent</q> so we can isolate it.
      </p>

      <p>
        If we end up with an equation that looks like
        <me>
          (0.337)^{\mathord{?}}=1.272
        </me>
        as in, <q>I wonder what the exponent is?,</q>
        we can use a logarithmic function to find the answer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although most likely a variable is used instead of a question mark, like
        <me>
          (0.337)^{x}=1.272
        </me>
        where <m>x</m> is the unknown value we are trying to find.
      </p>

      <p>
        Using <xref ref="item-logarithm-of-power-rule">Rule</xref>
        and applying any logarithm to both sides of the equation we can work our way towards isolating the unknown variable <m>x</m>.
      </p>

      <example>
        <title>Isolate and solve for the unknown variable</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            <md>
              <mrow>(0.337)^{x}=1.272</mrow>
              <mrow>\log(0.337)^{x}= \log(1.272)</mrow>
              <mrow>x \log(0.337)= \log(1.272)</mrow>
              <mrow>x=\frac{\log(1.272)}{\log(0.337)}</mrow>
              <mrow>x \approx -0.2212</mrow>
            </md>
          </p>

          <p>
            In this case we used <m>\log</m>,
            but we get the same answer using the natural logarithm,
            <m>\ln</m>, instead.
            Try it!
          </p>

          <p>
            It does not matter what base logarithm you use,
            as long as you use the same
            <m>\log_{b}</m> on both sides of the equation.
            However, it does help to use a function that is readily available on most calculators like base <m>10</m> (<m>\log</m>),
            or base <m>e</m>
            (<m>\ln</m>).
          </p>
        </statement>
      </example>

      <p>
        Now you try it.
        Solve an exponential equation using <xref ref="item-logarithm-of-power-rule">Rule</xref>.
      </p>

      <exercise>

        <introduction>
          <p>
            How many <m>7 \%</m> increases is the same as one <m>49 \%</m> increase?
          </p>
        </introduction>

        <webwork>
            <stage>
            <statement>
              <p>
                The growth factor associated with a <m>7 \%</m> increase is <m>b=</m><var name="1.07" width="4" />.
              </p>
            </statement>
            </stage>
            <stage>
            <statement>
              <p>
                The equation below literally states,
                <q>An unknown number of growth factors <m>b=1.07</m> is the same as <m>1.49</m></q>
                <me>
                  (1.07)^{x}=1.49
                </me>
              </p>

              <p>
                Apply your favorite logarithm to each side of the equation.
                My favorite is <m>\ln</m>, so the equation is now
                <me>
                  \ln\mathopen{}\left(1.07^x\right)\mathclose{}= \ln(1.49)
                </me>
              </p>

              <p>
                Invoke <xref ref="item-logarithm-of-power-rule">Rule</xref>
                so that the exponent can come down in front of the expression on the left
                <me>
                  x \ln(1.07)= \ln(1.49)
                </me>
              </p>

              <p>
                Last step, isolate the variable by dividing both sides by
                <m>\ln(1.07)</m>, and what do you get?
              </p>

              <p>
                <m>x=</m> <var name="'ln(1.49)/ln(1.07)'" width="5" />
              </p>
            </statement>
            </stage>
        </webwork>
      </exercise>

      <p>
        <xref ref="item-logarithm-of-power-rule">Rule</xref> is great,
        but if we want to use it as the main tool we have to know when it applies and how to deal with the situation if the rule does not apply.
      </p>

      <example>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Solve the equation for <m>x</m>
            <me>
              3(2.83)^{x}=15
            </me>
          </p>

          <p>
            At first glance it seems you can apply <xref ref="item-logarithm-of-power-rule">Rule</xref>,
            but is that right?
            <xref ref="item-logarithm-of-power-rule">Rule</xref> states
            <me>
              \log_{b}(N^{x})=x \log_{b}(N)
            </me>
          </p>

          <p>
            Notice how <xref ref="item-logarithm-of-power-rule">Rule</xref>
            assumes you have one side written as <m>N^{x}</m> with nothing else in front
            (no coefficient).
            The left side of our equation has a coefficient of <m>3</m> in front of the exponential
            <me>
              3(2.83)^{x}
            </me>
            The constant <m>3</m> is keeping us from using <xref ref="item-logarithm-of-power-rule">Rule</xref>.
            That constant either has to be moved or we have to use another rule
            (if there is one that applies).
          </p>

          <p>
            We can fix the situation by rearranging the equation to match the format of <xref ref="item-logarithm-of-power-rule">Rule</xref>
            or we could use <xref ref="item-logarithm-of-product-rule">Rule </xref>
            because at least it matches the format of our equation.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            The constant <m>3</m> needs to be moved so only the exponential remains on the left side of the equation.
            <me>
              (2.83)^{x}=\frac{15}{3}
            </me>
            Voil&#224;! Now we have the correct form to use <xref ref="item-logarithm-of-power-rule">Rule</xref>.
            Apply your favorite logarithm to both sides.
            I'll use <m>\ln</m> this time because I used <m>\log</m> in the last example.
            <me>
              \ln (2.83)^{x}= \ln \left( \frac{15}{3} \right)
            </me>
            The exponent comes down and we have:
            <me>
              x \ln(2.83)= \ln \left( \frac{15}{3} \right)
            </me>
            The last step is to isolate the variable
            <me>
              x= \frac{\ln \left( \frac{15}{3} \right)}{\ln(2.83)}
            </me>
            so that (rounded to three decimals):
            <me>
              x \approx 1.547
            </me>
          </p>

          <p>
            Alternatively,
            we can use <xref ref="item-logarithm-of-product-rule">Rule </xref>.
            In English <xref ref="item-logarithm-of-product-rule">Rule </xref> says,
            <q>The log of a product is equal to the sum of the logs.</q>
          </p>

          <p>
            Applying <m>\ln</m> to both sides of our equation,
            we in fact have the log of the product <m>3</m> times <m>(2.83)^{x}</m> on the left side
            <me>
              \ln (3(2.83)^{x})=\ln(15)
            </me>
            Use <xref ref="item-logarithm-of-product-rule">Rule </xref>
            to write the left side of the equation as the sum of the logs
            <me>
              \ln(3)+\ln\mathopen{}\left(2.83^x\right)\mathclose{}=\ln(15)
            </me>
            Remember the goal is to isolate the variable <m>x</m> which we can now do since,
            on the left side, one term has <m>x</m> and the other does not.
          </p>

          <p>
            Subtracting <m>\ln(3)</m> from both sides we get
            <me>
              \ln\mathopen{}\left(2.83^x\right)\mathclose{}=\ln(15)-\ln(3)
            </me>
            Look, we get to use <xref ref="item-logarithm-of-power-rule">Rule</xref> anyway!
            On the left we bring down the exponent, <m>x</m>
            <me>
              x \ln(2.83)=\ln(15)-\ln(3)
            </me>
            Now isolate <m>x</m>
            <me>
              x=\frac{\ln(15)-\ln(3)}{\ln(2.83)}
            </me>
            We get the same answer as before
            <me>
              x \approx 1.547
            </me>
          </p>

          <p>
            Which method did you like better?
          </p>
        </solution>
      </example>

      <exercise>

        <introduction>
          <p>
            Of course we could have just solved the equation
            <m>3(2.83)^{x}=15</m> graphically and avoided the algebra all together.
          </p>
        </introduction>

                The graph of the exponential function

        <p>
          A note about solving.
          In the two algebra examples we were able to find exact solutions:
          <me>
            x= \frac{\ln \big( \frac{15}{3} \big)}{\ln(2.83)}
          </me>
          is exact.
        </p>

          We then entered the exact expressions into a calculator and found approximations rounded to three decimal places.
          Though graphically may seem quick and easy,
          most often we can only get an approximation to the answer.

      <p>
        Finally, we could just ask a computer to solve the equation for us.
        Many websites have tools for solving equations.
        You can enter an equation like: <c>3(2.83)^x = 15</c> and then type
        <em>solve</em> or click a <em>solve</em>
        button to see the solutions.
        You may wish to perform a web search for such a website.

        We should all be aware that technology can now do much of what only people could do in the past.
        And we should also be aware of the current limitations of technology.
      </p>

      <p>
        In fact, computers can solve all kinds of equations,
        but so far only people have the ability to set the problems up.
        So the real question is not necessarily
        <q>Can you solve an equation?,</q>,
        but <q>Do you have the right equation?</q>

      <title>Domain and Range</title>
      <p>
        Because a logarithm is just another kind of function,
        it has a domain and a range and the graph of a logarithmic function has its own characteristics that make it unique.
      </p>

      <p>
        We can use our language approach to understand the domain and range of a logarithmic function.
        Remember the literal translation of the expression <m>\log(x)</m> is
        <q>The power of <m>10</m> that gives you <m>x</m>.</q>
      </p>

      <example>
        <statement>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <m>\log(100)</m> means <q>The power of <m>10</m> that gives you <m>100</m>.</q>
                </p>

                <p>
                  Therefore
                  <me>
                    \log(100)=2
                  </me>
                  which says, <q>The power of <m>10</m> that gives you <m>100</m> is <m>2</m></q>,
                  since <m>10^{2}=100</m>.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  <m>\log_{3}(81)</m> means,
                  <q>The power of <m>3</m> that gives you <m>81</m>.</q>
                </p>

                <p>
                  Therefore
                  <me>
                    \log_{3}(81)=4
                  </me>
                  which says, <q>The power of <m>3</m> that gives you <m>81</m> is <m>4</m></q>,
                  since <m>3^{4}=81</m>
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </statement>
      </example>

      <p>
        Recall the domain of a function <m>f</m> is the set of all possible inputs the function can use
        (values that make sense for the function).
      </p>

      <p>
        Let
        <me>
          f(x)=\log_{3}(x)
        </me>
        where <m>x</m> is the input.
      </p>

      <p>
        Consider negative input values,
        like <m>x=-9</m> and think about the meaning of <m>\log_{3}(-9)</m>:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <q>What power of <m>3</m> gives you <m>-9</m>?</q>
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The statement should make no sense.
        You cannot get a negative result if all you have is positive <m>3</m>'s multiplied together.
        At least one has to be negative!
      </p>

      <p>
        Since any negative input leads us to the same conclusion,
        it turns out logarithms cannot accept negative inputs.
      </p>

      <p>
        For a similar reason logarithmic functions cannot have zero as an input.
        If you ask <q>How many factors of <m>3</m> does it take to get <m>0</m>?</q>
        or just <m>3^{\mathord{?}}=0</m>,
        it should be clear there is no answer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Therefore, the domain of any logarithmic function is all inputs that are greater than or equal to zero.
      </p>

      <assemblage>
        <p>
          Domain of <m>\log_{b}(x)</m>:
          <m>x \gt 0</m>.
        </p>
      </assemblage>

      <p>
        For the range we must consider all the possible outputs of the function.
        In the case of the logarithm,
        an output is the exponent value needed to get a particular input
        <me>
          \log_{b}(\text{input})=\text{output}
        </me>
      </p>

      <example>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Consider again <m>y=\log_{3}(x)</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            For any input <m>x</m> how many <m>3</m>'s does it take to get that <m>x</m>-value?
            The answer (output) is the <m>y</m>-value.
          </p>

          <p>
            For inputs between zero and one,
            <m>0 \lt x \lt 1</m>, the results are negative, so <m>y \lt 0</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            For inputs greater than one,

              \log_{3}(1)=0

            because, <q>The power of <m>3</m> that gives you <m>1</m></q> is the <m>0</m> power.
          </p>

          <p>
            After a few tries we should begin to realize the range of <m>\log_{3}(x)</m> is all real numbers.

      <p>

      <title>Change of Base</title>
      <p>
        So far, when evaluating expressions like
        <m>\log_{3}(9)</m> it seems we need to know the answer before we evaluate.
        How do you evaluate an expression when you don't already know the answer?
      </p>

      <example>
        <p>
          Evaluate <m>\log_{3}(0.1822)</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          We know the answer should be negative because we are trying to get <m>0.1822</m> which is less than <m>1</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your calculator may already have a
          <q>log of any base</q> option.
          Today, in the 21st century we can also find the answer,
          for free,
          on the web.
          For instance, go to
          <url href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/1t5iqhqaad">Desmos.com</url>.
          Type <c>log_(0.1822)</c> into one of the cells.
          You should see the answer as
          <m>\log_{3}(0.1822) \approx -1.5498</m> and you can get more decimal places if you want.
        </p>

        <p>
          But before the web,
          it used to be that calculators only had one or two options for logarithms,
          (and before calculators there were things called
          <q><url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slide_rule">slide rules</url></q>
          and books with pages and pages of tables of logarithms).
        </p>

        <p>
          Here is an <q>old school</q> method of evaluating a logarithm expression.
          The method is called <q>change of base</q>
          which means you change the base from whatever it is to either base <m>10</m>,
          <m>\log</m>, or base <m>e</m>,
          <m>\ln</m>, because most calculators have those built in.
        </p>

        <p>
          Set up an equation in which <m>y</m> is the answer you want.
          Then use the definition of the logarithm to turn the <m>log_{b}</m> equation into an exponential equation.
          The last step is to solve the exponential equation using the most convenient logarithm at your disposal
          (most likely <m>log</m> or <m>ln</m>).
          In this example we use log-base-10, <m>\log</m>.
          <md>
            <mrow>\log_{3}(0.1822)\amp=y</mrow>
            <mrow>0.1822\amp=3^{y}</mrow>
            <mrow>\log(0.1822)\amp=\log(3^{y})</mrow>
            <mrow>\log(0.1822)\amp=y\log(3)</mrow>
            <mrow>y\amp=\frac{\log(0.1822)}{\log(3)}</mrow>
            <mrow>y\amp\approx -1.5498</mrow>

            <statement>
              <p>
                A radioactive substance has a <em>continuous</em>
                hourly decay rate of <m><var name="$chdrp" />\%</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                What is the percent hourly decay rate?
              </p>

              <p>
                The opening sentence is telling us we must use an exponential model because the decay rate is a
                <q>constant percent</q>.
                The sentence goes on to tell us <em>what kind</em>
                of decay model and the percent rate of decay.
              </p>

              <p>
                The word <q>continuous</q> is telling us to use base <m>e</m>.
                Therefore we can write the formula for decay as
                <me>
                  Ae^{kt}
                </me>
                where <m>k</m> is the continuous decay constant <m>k=<var name="$k" /></m>.
                This value is negative because we are told the <m>21 \%</m> is a decrease.
              </p>

              <p>
                The value <m>A</m> represents the initial amount of substance,
                but it was not stated.
                So we put a variable there to hold its place.
              </p>

              <p>
                The question is about the hourly percent decay.
                But, we were given the <q>continuous</q> hourly decay.
                These are two different things.
              </p>

              <p>
                A discrete model would look like
                <me>
                  Ab^{t}
                </me>
                where <m>b</m> is the hourly growth factor we are trying to find.
                But both the discrete and continuous models have to predict the same behavior.
                Therefore the two formulas have to be equal <mdash /> they have to produce the same values.
                <me>
                  A(b)^{t}=A(e^{-k})^t
                </me>
                Notice how the parentheses are used to show that both sides are actually the same thing.
                Both say
                <me>

                A population increases at an annual rate of about <m><var name="$arp" />\%</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                What is the continuous annual growth rate?
              </p>

              <p>
                The opening sentence is telling us we must use an exponential model because the growth is a
                <q>constant percent</q>.
                The sentence goes on to tell us <em>what kind</em>
                of growth model and the percent rate of growth.
              </p>

              <p>
                Annual percent growth is called
                <q>discrete growth</q>.
                Not because it is annual, per se,
                but because it is measured at the end of some finite time interval.
                Other examples of discrete growth
                (or decay)
                would be described as <q>monthly</q> or <q>daily</q> etc.
                Another way to tell it is discrete is the absence of the word <q>continuous</q>.
                If the growth is not continuous, then it is discrete.
              </p>

              <p>
                A discrete model looks like
                <me>
                  Ab^{t}
                </me>
                where in our case <m>b</m> is the annual growth factor and <m>A</m> represents the initial size of the population which we are not given.
              </p>

              <p>
                A continuous model would be
                <me>
                  Ae^{kt}
                </me>
                where <m>k</m> is the continuous growth constant and <m>A</m> still represents the initial amount.
              </p>

              <p>
                These models must be equal because they are describing the same population.
                Therefore
                <me>
                  A(b)^{t}=A(e^{k})^{t}
                </me>
                Notice what is the same on each side and what is different.
              </p>

              <p>

                A population of mosquitoes doubles every <m><var name="$doublingdays" /> </m> days.
              </p>

              <p>
                Time units in this problem are <q>day</q> singular.
              </p>

              <p>
                What is the daily percent growth of the population?
              </p>

              <p>
                A pattern of repeated doubling is the same thing as a pattern of repeated multiplication,
                in this case multiplication by <m>2</m>.
                Therefore, the growth of the population is exponential.
              </p>

              <p>
                We need to translate the English sentence <lq/>A population of mosquitoes doubles every <m><var name="$doublingdays" /></m> days<rq/> into a math sentence (a formula).
              </p>

              <p>
                We know there must be some initial population,
                call it <m>P</m> and we know to multiply by <m>2</m> every <m><var name="$doublingdays" /></m> days.
              </p>

              <p>
                Therefore a formula could be <m>P(t)=</m> <var name="$form" width="10" />
                <em>(use a fractional exponent in your answer)</em>.
              </p>

              <p>
                The fractional exponent is then used to calculate the daily growth factor <m>2^{\frac{1}{<var name="$doublingdays" />}} = </m> <var name="$b" width="10" />
                <em>(round to <m>3</m> decimal places)</em>.
              </p>

              <p>
                From our growth factor we determine the daily percent growth as <m>(2^{\frac{1}{<var name="$doublingdays" />}} -1) \cdot 100 = </m> <var name="$dgr" width="10" />

              <p>
                A half-life is the time it takes for the chemical to decay to half its current value.
                We are told the half-life is <var name="$halflifemin" /> minutes,

                In the study of populations
                (population dynamics)
                the situation often arises where we must solve logarithmic equations.
              </p>

              <p>
                For instance,
                when searching for an equation to model a population that has a carrying capacity (a maximum number the population can sustain) we can end up with an equation like
                <me>
                  \ln(P)-\ln(1-P)=t
                </me>
                in which the goal is to isolate <m>P</m> as a function of <m>t</m>.
                It is a good exercise in algebra and log rules.
              </p>

              <p>
                Use <xref ref="item-logarithm-of-quotient-rule">Rule</xref>
                to write the left side of the equation
                <me>
                  \ln(P)-\ln(1-P)=t
                </me>
                as one term.

                Use the definition of the logarithm that states
                <m>\log_{b}(x)=y</m> means <m>b^{y}=x</m>,
                to rewrite the equation <m>\ln(\frac{P}{1-P})=t</m> as an exponential equation
                <me>
                  \frac{P}{1-P}=e^{t}
                </me>
              </p>

              <p>
                Multiply both sides of the equation
                <m>\frac{P}{1-P}=e^{t}</m> by <m>(1-P)</m> and distribute on the right side to get
                <me>
                  P=e^{t}-Pe^{t}
                </me>
              </p>

              <p>
                Collect the terms with <m>P</m> on the left of
                <me>
                  P+Pe^{t}=e^{t}
                </me>
                and factor out <m>P</m> so that
                <me>
                  P(1+e^{t})=e^{t}
                </me>
              </p>

              <p>
                Now solve for <m>P</m> to get the final answer.

              <p>
                If we introduce an initial population of <m>750</m> then we can graph the population equation as a function of time.
              </p>

              <p>
                The population increases for <m>t \gt 0</m>.
                However, there seems to be a limit to how large the population can get.
              </p>

              <p>
                Increase the time (input) by dragging the green,
                cross-hair to the right along the horizontal axis.
                Is there a limit to how large the population can get?
              </p>

              <p>
                The population, <m>P \lt</m> <var name="1500" width="10" />.
              </p>

              <p>
                There is an imaginary line that acts as the upper limit of the population size for <m>t \gt 0</m>.
                Click the checkbox in the graphing area to show the line.
                What is the equation for the horizontal line?
              </p>

              <p>
                The equation of the line is <m>y=</m> <var name="1500" width="10" />.
              </p>

              <p>
                The line is actually an example of a horizontal asymptote.
                The function is increasing, yet always remains below the line.

              According to <em>Newton's Law of Cooling</em>, the rate at which
              a hot object cools down depends on certain factors, including the

              object's temperature and the surrounding temperature.

              According to Wolfram|Alpha, the population of Texas has been
              growing by about <m>1.92\%</m> per year since <m>1960</m>. In <m>1960</m>,
              the population was about <m>9.624</m> million people.
            </p>

            <p>
              Write an exponential formula to model the population of Texas. Here,
              the input <m>t</m> should be the number of years after <m>1960</m>,
              and the output <m>f(t)</m> should be the population <em>in millions</em>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Answer: <m>f(t) = </m><var name="$formula" width="10" />

              An exponential function has the form
              <me>
                f(t) = a(b)^t
              </me>
              where <m>a</m> is the initial value, and <m>b</m> is the growth factor.
              Using the information given, we know that <m>9.624</m> is the initial
              value (remember the output represents <em>millions</em> of people)
              and the growth factor is <m>1 + 0.0192 = 1.0192</m>. Therefore, the
              formula is:
              <me>
                f(t) = <var name="$formula" />

                  (discovered by astronomer Simon Newcomb)
                  is an observation about large sets of multi-digit numbers.
                  In particular,
                  it says that the first digit of a number is more likely to be a <m>1</m> than a <m>2</m>,
                  more likely to be <m>2</m> than <m>3</m>, etc.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Newcomb modeled this phenomenon by the function
                  <me>
                    p(n) = 100 \log_{10} \left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)
                  </me>
                  which gives the percent of numbers that begin with the digit <m>n</m>.
                  Here, the domain of <m>p</m> is just the set of whole numbers <m>\{1,2,3, \cdots , 9\}</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  According to Benford's Law,
                  about how many times as likely is it for a number to begin with the digit <m>1</m> as it is to begin with the digit <var name="$digit" />?
                  Round your answer to the nearest whole number.

              </statement>
              <solution>
                <p>
                  About <m>100 \log_{10}\left(1 + \frac{1}{1}\right) \approx 30.1 \%</m> of numbers begin with the digit <m>1</m>,
                  and about <m>100 \log_{10} \left(1 + \frac{1}{<var name="$digit" />}\right) \approx <var name="$rounded" /> \%</m> of numbers begin with the digit <var name="$digit" />.
                </p>

                <p>
                  So, it is about <m>\frac{30.1}{<var name="$rounded" />} \approx <var name="$prob" /></m> times as likely to begin with <m>1</m> than with <m><var name="$digit" /></m>.

                  (named for psychologist William Edmund Hick)
                  says that when people must make a choice from a set of options,
                  the time it takes them increases
                  <em>logarithmically</em>
                  as the number of possible options increases.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In particular, the law says that the time, <m>T</m>,
                  it takes to make a choice can be modeled by the equation
                  <me>
                    T = b \log_2(n+1)
                  </me>
                  where <m>n</m> represents the number of options from which to choose,
                  and <m>b</m> is a constant number related to factors such as the type of decision being made.

                  The frequency of a musical tone defines the pitch we hear,
                  which we may give a note value
                  (such as G or D#).
                  Mathematically, frequency is measured in <em>hertz</em>.
                  A higher number of hertz for a tone means the tone sounds higher.
                </p>

                <p>
                  On a piano, we have the following notes:
                  <em>A, A#, B, C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A</em>.
                  This is called one <em>octave</em> of notes,
                  and these same notes repeat in the next octave
                  (just at higher frequencies).
                  We call the distance between successive notes in an octave a <em>semitone</em>.
                  So, the distance from <em>A</em>
                  to <em>C</em> is <m>3</m> semitones,
                  and the distance between <em>A</em>
                  and the next <em>A</em> is <m>12</m> semitones.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Now, the note <em>middle A</em>
                  has a frequency of <m>440</m> Hertz.
                  To calculate the frequency of a note, we use the formula
                  <me>
                    F(x) = 440(2)^{x/12}
                  </me>
                  where <m>x</m> is the number of semitones a note is above middle <em>A</em>.

                  What note has a frequency of <m>1046.5</m> Hertz?

                  we can solve for <m>x</m>:

                  The note is <m>15</m> semitones above middle <em>A</em>.
                  Since the next <em>A</em> is <em>12</em>
                  semitones above middle <em>A</em>,
                  those extra <m>3</m> semitones mean we are at the note <em>C</em>.

                  theory.
                  Known as the <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_problem">Best Choice Problem</url>,
                  it concerns hiring someone for a job under the following conditions:
                </p>

                <p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        You have <m>n</m> people to interview.
                      </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      <p>
                        You interview them one-by-one.
                      </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      <p>
                        After each person is interviewed,
                        you must immediately make the decision of whether to hire them or not.
                        If you hire them,
                        you're done and you cannot interview anymore candidates.
                      </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      <p>
                        If you reject a candidate
                        (decide <em>not</em> to hire them),
                        you can't change your mind later.
                      </p>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                  Under these conditions,
                  you may wonder how to actually choose the best person for the job.
                  If you choose a good candidate early on,
                  you may miss the opportunity to hire a really <em>great</em>
                  candidate later down the line.
                  If you wait too long,
                  you may only be left with mediocre candidates from which to choose.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The solution is to interview the first
                  <m>\frac{n}{e}</m> candidates but reject <em>all</em> of them,
                  regardless of their qualifications.
                  Then, continue interviewing candidates until you find the first one that is <q>better</q>
                  than the first group you rejected.
                  Hire this person.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Interestingly,
                  this simple rule has been shown to find the best candidate in a group approximately <m>37 \%</m> of the time,
                  no matter the size of the group!

                  The equation for the asset's value is:

                  We must rewrite this as <m>Ae^{kt}</m>,
