            A manufacturer purchases raw materials from a supplier and then makes
            products to sell. The amount of money the manufacturer makes from
            selling one of these products depends on how much they have spend
            on the materials. At the same time, however, the price of materials
            changes throughout the year.

            Arizona Cardinals running back LaRod Stephens-Howling once returned
            a kick-off to make a <m>102</m>-yard touchdown against the Oakland Raiders.
            The ball was kicked from the <m>30</m>-yard line, and it was caught
            <m>2</m> yards into the end zone. Watching the YouTube video of the kick-off,
            I approximated the angle at which the ball was kicked and, with the
            help of the internet and an old physics book, I determined the path
            of the ball could be modeled using the formula
            <me>f(x)=\frac{-1}{256}x^2+\frac{216}{256}x</me> where <m>x</m> is the
            horizontal distance of the ball (measured in feet) away from where
            the ball was kicked, and <m>f(x)</m> is its height above the ground
            (measured in feet).

            A famous application involving the number <m>e</m> comes from Optimal Stopping  theory. Known as the Best Choice Problem, it concerns hiring someone for a job under the following conditions:
          </p>
            <p>
               <ul>
                 <li>
                   <p>
                    You have n people to interview.
                   </p>
                 </li>
                 <li>
                   <p>
                     You interview them one-by-one.
                   </p>
                 </li>
                 <li>
                   <p>
                     After each person is interviewed, you must immediately make the decision of whether to hire them or not. If you decide to hire someone, you’re done and you cannot interview any more candidates.
                   </p>
                 </li>
                 <li>
                   <p>
                     If you reject a candidate (decide not to hire them), you can’t change your mind later.
                   </p>
                 </li>
               </ul>
             </p>
          <p>
            Under these conditions, you may wonder how to actually choose the best person for the job. If you choose a good candidate early on, you may miss the opportunity to hire a really great candidate later. If you wait too long, you may only be left with mediocre candidates from which to choose. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The solution is to interview the first <m>\frac{n}/{e}</m> candidates but reject all of them, regardless of their qualifications. Then, continue interviewing candidates until you find the first one that is “better” than the first group you rejected. Then hire this person. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Interestingly, this simple rule has been shown to find the best candidate in a group approximately 37% of the time, no matter the size of the group!
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Question:</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Suppose a group of people line up to be chosen as an extra in a movie. The casting director only has time to interview people one at a time and make a decision -- yes or no. Suppose the casting director is familiar with the Best Choice Problem, and she interviews and rejects the first 25 people in line. How many people are in line? Round your answer to the closest whole number.

            products to sell. The amount of money the manufacturer makes from
