            Arizona Cardinals running back LaRod Stephens-Howling once returned
            a kick-off to make a <m>102</m>-yard touchdown against the Oakland Raiders.
            The ball was kicked from the <m>30</m>-yard line, and it was caught
            <m>2</m> yards into the end zone. Watching the YouTube video of the kick-off,
            I approximated the angle at which the ball was kicked and, with the
            help of the internet and an old physics book, I determined the path
            of the ball could be modeled using the formula
            <me>f(x)=\frac{-1}{256}x^2+\frac{216}{256}x</me> where <m>x</m> is the
            horizontal distance of the ball (measured in feet) away from where
            the ball was kicked, and <m>f(x)</m> is its height above the ground
            (measured in feet).

            A manufacturer purchases raw materials from a supplier and then makes
            products to sell. The amount of money the manufacturer makes from
            selling one of these products depends on how much they have spend
            on the materials. At the same time, however, the price of materials
            changes throughout the year.
