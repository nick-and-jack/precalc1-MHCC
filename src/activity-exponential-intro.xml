  <title>Introduction to Exponential Functions</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>You may have heard, <q>The world is constantly changing</q>.  But the big question is <q>How?</q> Is there a pattern?  In math patterns have names.</p>
    <p><term>Linear</term> is the name of a pattern.  If you graph a linear formula, it looks like a straight line.  If you look at the data of a linear pattern you will notice the data has a constant <term>rate of change</term> in other words constant slope.</p>
    <p>In this section we study a pattern in which something else remains constant, but it's not the rate of change, it is the percent.</p>
  </introduction>

  <subsection>
    <title>Review of Percent Change</title> 
    <p>A <term>percent change</term> on a value means to change it by a fraction of itself.  When someone gets a <m>10 \%</m> raise in salary it means that their salary was divided into pieces <me>\frac{\displaystyle{10}}{\displaystyle{100}} = \frac{\displaystyle{1}}{\displaystyle{10}}</me> and one of those pieces was added onto their original salary.  Think of it like this</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>New Salary = Old Salary + <m>1/10</m> of Old Salary</p>
        <p>New Salary = Old Salary + <m>0.10</m> of Old Salary</p>
    </blockquote>
        <p>If we let <m>N</m> represent the new salary and <m>s</m> represent the old salary we can write</p>
        <md>
            <mrow>N \amp= s + 0.1s</mrow>
        </md>
    <p>Notice when we look at the statement as an equation, the variable <m>s</m> is factor of both terms on the right.  Therefore <m>s</m> can be factored out and the equation can be rewritten as</p>
        <md>
            <mrow>N \amp= (1 + 0.1)s</mrow>
            <mrow>N \amp= 1.1s</mrow>
        </md>
    <p>We are now able to think of a <m>10 \%</m> increase as a multiple of <m>1.1</m>  where the <m>1</m> represents the <m>100 \%</m> you already had and the <m>0.1</m> represents the <m>10 \%</m> increase.</p>
    <p>When a percent value is given we must turn that value into its <term>decimal equivlent</term> so we can use it.  The value <m>10 \%</m> has a decimal equivalent of <m>\frac{\displaystyle{10}}{\displaystyle{100}} = 0.1</m>.  In fact, the decimal equivalent of any percent value is that value divided by 100.</p>
    <me>
        r = \frac{\displaystyle{\text{Pecent Value}}}{\displaystyle{100}}
    </me>
    <p>A percent increase means to multiply the original value by <m>1 + r</m> where <m>r</m> is the decimal equivalent of the given percent. In our salary example <m>r = 0.1</m> so we multiplied by <m>1 + 0.1 = 1.1</m> to get the <m>10 \%</m> increase.</p>
    <p>The factor <m>1.1</m> is called the <term>growth factor</term> and is usually denoted as <m>b</m></p>
    <p>For exponential growth the <term>growth factor</term>is defined as</p>
    <me>b = 1 + r</me>
    <p>Notice that the growth factor is greater than 1 for exponential growth.</p>

                    <p>The value of a stock was at <m>\$ 21.32</m> per share yesterday. Today that same stock is valued at <m>\$ 24.07</m> per share. What is the percent increase in the value of the stock? Round your answer to 1 decimal place.</p>
                    <p>The stock value increase by <var name="$increase2" width="5" /> <m>\%</m>.</p>
                </statement>
            </webwork>
        </exercise>
    <p>Just like something can increase by a percent, it is possible to have a percent decrease.</p>
    <p>Consider a pair of shorts on sale where the original price of the shorts has been reduced by 15%.  This means the price of the shorts is divided into pieces and one of those pieces is subtracted from the original price of the shorts.</p>  
    <p>To reduce the price by <m>15 \%</m> we must turn the percent value into its decimal equivalent.  The decimal equivalent of <m>15 \%</m> is <m>\frac{\displaystyle{15}}{\displaystyle{100}} = 0.15</m>.</p>
    <p>Therefore the sale price of the shorts is</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>New Price = Old Price <m>-</m> <m>0.15</m> * Old Price</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>If we let <m>N</m> represent the new price and <m>p</m> represent the old price we can write</p>
    <md>
        <mrow>N \amp= p - 0.15p</mrow>
    </md>
    <p>Again, notice that <m>p</m> is a common factor in both terms on the right, so we can write</p>
    <md>
        <mrow>N \amp= (1 - 0.15)p</mrow>
        <mrow>N \amp= 0.85p</mrow>
    </md>
    <p>Look at what we end up with.  A <m>15 \%</m> reduction in price means to multiply the original price by <m>0.85</m>.  What we are seeing in the calculation is the price we actually pay, that is <m>85 \%</m> of the original price.  We have to think a little bit to realize the decrease is <m>15 \%</m></p>
    <p>A percent decrease means to multiply the original value by <m>1 - r</m> where <m>r</m> is the decimal equivalent of the given percent.</p>
    <p>Consider a study on the reduction of asthma.</p>

    <p>Something to consider about a percent decrease is, <q>How much can we decrease?</q> Let's think about that for a moment.</p>
    <p>If you have 10 apples, you can eat <m>50 \%</m> of them, that's half the apples.  You can eat <m>75 \%</m> of them, that's <m>7 \frac{1}{2}</m> apples.  You can even eat all the apples, that's <m>100 \%</m> of the apples!</p>
    <p>But, can you eat more than all the apples you have?  If you only have <m>10</m> apples, you cannot eat more than <m>10</m> apples, you cannot decrease by more than <m>100 \%</m> of what you have.</p>
    <p>Therefore when it comes to a percent loss, the growth factor is less than <m>1</m> for sure, but it cannot be less than <m>0</m>. Furthermore, since muliplying by zero is zero, it makes the <q>growth</q> very uninetesting.  From now on a growth factor is always strictly greater than zero.  The only choices are to be greater than <m>1</m> or between <m>0</m> and <m>1</m></p>

  <subsection>
    <title>Constant Percent Change</title>
    <p>We now know in order to change a value by a percent, we need to multiply.</p>
    <p>If we multiply by a factor between <m>0</m> and <m>1</m> we get a percent decrease while if we multiply by a factor greater than 1 we get a percent increase.</p>
    <p>By the way, what happens when you multiply by a factor of <m>1</m>? [Hint: nothing]</p>
    <p>In the exercises below, find the percent change in the given expression.</p>

        <p>Consecutive multiplication is essentially consecutive percent change. When there are countable changes in percent (multiplying by some number over and over) it is called <term>discrete compounding</term>.</p>
        <p>At the moment, <q>countable</q> may seem strange.  It means <q>A number you can count or put on a number line</q> like <m>12</m> or <m>205</m> or
         or <m>5235</m>
         or <m>168,463</m>

         <p>You must be wondering <q>what's not countable?</q> Well, how about infinity?  Infinity is not countable, it's not a number you can put on a number line. We'll talk more about infinite compounding later.</p>
