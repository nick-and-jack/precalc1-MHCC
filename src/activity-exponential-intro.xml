  <title>Introduction to Exponential Functions</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>You may have heard, <q>The world is constantly changing</q>.  But the big question is <q>How?</q> Is there a pattern?  In math, patterns have names.</p>
    <p><em>Linear</em> is the name of a pattern. A <term>linear equation</term><idx><h>linear</h><h>equation</h></idx> may look like this <me>y=mx+b</me> and its graph is a straight line.</p>

    <p>If you look at a table of values from a <term>linear pattern</term><idx><h>Linear</h><h>pattern</h></idx>, you will notice the data have a constant rate of change; in other words, a constant slope.</p>

    <p>In this section we study a pattern in which something remains constant, but not the rate of change; it is the <em>percent change</em>. An <term>exponential pattern</term><idx><h>exponential</h><h>pattern</h></idx> has the characteristic of having <em>constant percent change</em>.</p>

    <title>Percent Change, Multiplication and the Growth Factor</title>
    <p>Before we explore exponential functions, we should have a very good understanding of percent, what it means and how it is calculated.</p>
    <example>
      <statement><p>Quickly test yourself:</p>
      <p>
        <ol label="a">
          <li><p>Can you increase the number <m>745</m> by <m>12 \%</m>?</p></li>
          <li><p>Can you decrease the number <m>38.2</m> by <m>25 \%</m>?</p></li>
          <li><p>Which of the following expressions will find <m>60 \%</m> of <m>1450</m>?</p>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li><p><m>1450(60)</m></p></li>
                <li><p><m>1450(0.60)</m></p></li>
                <li><p><m>1450 + 0.60</m></p></li>
                <li><p><m>1450 - 1450(0.40)</m></p></li>
              </ul>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><p>What is the decimal equivalent of <m>0.14 \%</m>?</p></li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          <ol label="a">
            <li><p><m>834.4</m></p></li>
            <li><p><m>29.19</m></p></li>
            <li><p>Only <m>1450(0.60)</m> and <m>1450 - 1450(0.40)</m> will find <m>60 \%</m> of <m>1450</m>.</p></li>
            <li><p>The decimal equivalent is: <m>0.0014</m></p></li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </answer>
    </example>
    <p>You may want a more in-depth review on the meanings of the terms <q>decimal equivalent</q> and <q>growth factor</q>. Follow this link to an interactive review of that material: <xref ref="activity-review-percent-change">review</xref></p>
    <p>In short, to change a number by a percent, we multiply.</p>
    <p>For instance if we start with the number <m>8</m>, then <m>8(1.25)</m> will increase the number <m>8</m> by <em>one and a quarter of itself</em>. You get all of the <m>8</m> and <m>25 \%</m> more.</p>
    <p>So, the equation <m>8(1.25) = 10</m> means that <m>10</m> is <m>25 \%</m> greater than <m>8</m></p>
    <p>On the other hand, if we again start with <m>8</m>, then <m>8(0.75)</m> is <em>a fraction of 8</em>; not all of it, only a portion. In fact, it means <m>75 \%</m> of <m>8</m>.</p>
    <p>Notice that keeping <m>75 \%</m> of 8 automatically means a <em>loss</em> of <m>25 \%</m>. So, the equation <m>8(0.75) = 6</m> says that <m>6</m> is <m>75 \%</m> of <m>8</m>, which also means that reducing <m>8</m> by <m>25 \%</m> will give us <m>6</m>.</p>
    <p>The number we multiply by to get the percent change is called the <term>growth factor</term><idx><h>growth factor</h></idx> <mdash/> even though it may actually result in a percent decrease. In this book we will refer to the growth factor with the variable <em>b</em>.</p>
    <example>
      <statement>
      <p>Given an initial value of <m>165</m>, identify the growth factor <m>b</m> in each expression and describe the percent change.</p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><m>165(1.12)</m></p>

        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>The growth factor is <m>b = 1.12</m>, and it means that <m>165</m> has been increased by <m>12 \%</m>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The growth factor is <m>b = 0.08</m>, and it means that <m>165</m> has been decreased by <m>92 \%</m>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The growth factor is <m>b = 2.69</m>, and it means that <m>165</m> has been increased by <m>169 \%</m>.</p>

    <title>Linear <init>vs.</init> Exponential Patterns</title>
     <p>Looking at data, lists of numbers, is related to almost every profession. We search for patterns in the data from past or current events to try to predict future events. We have questions, like:</p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>How long will a mechanical part last?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>When can we administer the next dose of medication?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>When will we get to our destination?</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Two common patterns are <em>linear</em> and <em>exponential</em>, and the news is full of them.</p>
    <example>
      <blockquote>
        <p><em>Exponential gains in computing power, along with innovations in software, analytical techniques and the rise of Big Data, mean that many white-collar occupations are due for disruption by machines too. According to a 2013 study by two Oxford University professors, almost half of all jobs in the United States are susceptible to “computerization” over the coming decade or two.</em></p>
        <p><mdash/><q>How Efficiency Is Wiping Out the Middle Class</q>, <em>Another View</em> by David Diegel, New York Times January 25, 2017</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>In writing, <q><em>Exponential</em> gains in computing power</q> this article claims <em>computing power</em> is increasing by a constant percent. It must be assumed that the increases happen over equal time intervals, like every year or every <m>10</m> years for the claim to be valid.</p>
    </example>
    <example>
      <blockquote>
        <p><em>In 2012 the average rent was $<m>2,225</m>. Every year it has risen roughly a hundred dollars. But in late 2016, the rental market suddenly became flat.</em></p>
        <p><em><q>If I were to bet, I would bet that prices are on the way down. I would bet the tenants and buyers are going to have the upper hand probably for the next two or three years,</q> said real estate broker Peter Zalewski.</em></p>
        <p><mdash/><q>After Years Of Price Hikes, South Florida's Rental Market Entering New Era Of Decline</q>, David Sutta, CBS Miami, March 29, 2017</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>This article is reporting a pattern of constant rate of change for monthly rent. The real estate broker quoted in the article is using a linear model to describe the rental market between <m>2012</m> and <m>2016</m>.</p>
    </example>
    <p>Distiguishing between linear and exponential patterns is as easy as knowing the difference between addition and multipication. The patterns allow us to find formulas for linear or exponential situations.</p>
    <assemblage>
      <p>A <term>linear pattern</term><idx><h>linear pattern</h><h>constant rate of change</h></idx> of constant rate of change is essentially repeated addition. A linear formula counts how many times you add the same number.</p>
      <p>An <term>exponential pattern</term><idx><h>exponential</h><h>pattern</h></idx> of constant percent change is essesntially repeated multiplication. An exponential formula counts how many times you multiply by the same number.</p>

    <title>A General Formula for Exponential Growth/Decay: Discrete Model</title>
      <assemblage>
      <p>You will find the word <term>compounded</term> in the exercises that follow.</p>
      <p><term>Compounding</term><idx><h>compounding</h></idx> is the process of repeatedly increasing or decreasing by a percent. It refers to the fact that each succesive percent change is based on a number already greater/lesser than the original. </p>
      <p><ul><li><p><em>Compounded monthly</em> means a percent is calculated each month.</p></li>
      <li><p><em>Compounded annually</em> means a percent is calculated each year.</p></li>
      <li><p>In the expression <m>500\cdot 1.15\cdot 1.15\cdot 1.15</m> the value <m>500</m> has been compounded three times by <m>15 \%</m>.</p></li></ul></p>
      </assemblage>
      <p>A common form for a linear equation is <m>y = mx + b</m>, although there are others. Exponential equations have their own form too. In this part of the activity we use a table of values to find a pattern in constant percent growth or decay then find a form for exponential functions.</p>
      <p>To find a pattern within numerical data, it is best to record how we get our results instead of the results themselves.</p>
      <p>As a way to convince you, here is an experiment.</p>
      <todo>Write an "if" statement so that if NEXT1 is the actual value or "0" for "I don't know" then it is correct.</todo>

              <solution>
                  <p>Both patterns are exactly the same.  One shows the results and the other shows how to get the results.</p>
                  <p>Most likely you found the second pattern to be the easiest to predict because you can see <em>how</em> you got the answers.</p>
                  <p>The first pattern shows only the results, so all you see is numbers without any clue how they were found.</p>
                  <p>In each case the next value is <var name="$Next1" />, but in the second pattern you can predict the calculation to be <me>5\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot  + 5 = 165 </me></p>

    <p>Now we have general forms for both linear <me>y=mx+b</me> and exponential <me>y=ab^{x}</me> equations.</p>
    <p>In the linear equation <me>y=mx+b</me> the variable <m>b</m> is sometimes referred to as the initial value. On a graph it represents the vertical intercept while <m>m</m> represents the rate of change (slope). The rate of change tells us the rate of increase (or decrease) <em>per unit</em> input.</p>
    <p>The variable <m>x</m> counts how many times the rate of change is added to the initial value.</p>
    <p>In the exponential equation <me>y = ab^{x}</me> the initial value is represented by <m>a</m>, and <m>b</m> is the growth factor. This equation, or model, is called the <term>discrete exponential</term> model.</p>
    <p>The growth factor tells us the percent increase (or decrease) <em>per unit</em> input while the variable <m>x</m> in this case counts how many times the growth factor is multiplied.</p>
    <p>Finding the growth factor <em>per unit</em> in an exponential formula can be tricky. We have been thinking in terms of linear (constant rate of change)for so long, we often think everything is linear.</p>
    <p>We need a way to convert a statement like <q><m>60 \%</m> over <m>3</m> years</q> into one about the percent growth <em>per year</em>. A good start is to remind ourselves how repeated addition is different than repeated multiplication.</p>

    <p>All exponential functions (of this form) have horizontal asymptotes.  The equation for a horizontal asymptote is <m>y=k</m> where <m>k</m> is the height of the horizontal line the function approaches.</p>
    <p>In the last example the function decreases to near zero, so <m>y=0</m> is the equation of the horizontal asymptote.</p>
