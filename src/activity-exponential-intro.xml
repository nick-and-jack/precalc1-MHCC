  <title>Introduction to Exponential Functions</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>You may have heard, <q>The world is constantly changing</q>.  But the big question is <q>How?</q> Is there a pattern?  In math, patterns have names.</p>
    <p>Linear is the name of a pattern. A <term>linear equation</term><index><main>linear</main><sub>equation</sub></index> may look like this <me>y=mx+b</me> and its graph is a straight line.</p>

    <p>If you look at the data from a <term>linear pattern</term><index><main>Linear</main><sub>pattern</sub></index> you will notice the data has a constant rate of change, in other words constant slope.</p>

    <p>In this section we study a pattern in which something remains constant, but it's not the rate of change, it is the <em>percent change</em>. An <term>exponential pattern</term><index><main>exponential</main><sub>pattern</sub></index> has the characteristic of <em>constant percent change</em>.</p>

  </introduction>
  <subsection>
    <title>Percent Change, Multiplication and the Growth Factor</title>
    <p>Before we explore exponential functions, we should have a very good understanding of percent, what it means and how it is calculated.</p>
    <p>Students may need a more in-depth review on the meanings of <q>decimal equivalent</q> and <q>growth factor</q>. Follow this link to an interactive review of that material: <xref ref="activity-review-percent-change">review</xref></p>
    <p>In short, to change a number by a percent, we multiply.</p>
    <p>For instance if we start with the number <m>8</m>, then <m>8\cdot 1.25</m> means to increase the number <m>8</m> by <em>one and a quarter of itself</em>. You get all of the <m>8</m> and <m>25 \%</m> more.</p>
    <p><m>8\cdot 1.25 = 10</m> means that <m>10</m> is <m>25 \%</m> greater than <m>8</m></p>
    <p>On the other hand, if we again start with <m>8</m> then <m>8\cdot 0.75</m> is <em>a fraction of 8</em>. Not all of it, only a portion. In fact, it means <m>75 \%</m> of <m>8</m>.</p>
    <p>Notice that keeping <m>75 \%</m> of 8 automatically means a <em>loss</em> of <m>25 \%</m>. The equation <m>8\cdot 0.75 = 6</m> says <m>6</m> is <m>75 \%</m> of <m>8</m> which also means <m>6</m> is <m>25 \%</m> less than <m>8</m>.</p>
    <p>The number we multiply by to get the percent change is called the <term>growth factor</term><index><main>growth factor</main></index> <mdash/> even though it may actually result in a percent decrease.</p>
    <p>In this book we will refer to the growth factor with the variable <em>b</em>.</p>
    <example>
      <p>Given an initial value of <m>165</m>, identify the growth factor b:</p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>The expression <m>165(1.12)</m> has a growth factor <m>b = 1.12</m></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The expression <m>165(0.081)</m> has a growth factor <m>b = 0.081</m></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The expression <m>165(5.69)</m> has a growth factor <m>b = 5.69</m></p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </example>
    <exercise>
      <introduction>
        <p>Use the growth factor to determine the percent change on the given initial value. The growth factor is shown in parentheses.</p>

    <title>Linear <init>vs.</init> Exponential Patterns</title>
     <p>Looking at data, lists of numbers, is part of almost everyone's profession. We search for patterns in the data from past or current events to try to predict future events. We have questions, like</p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>How long will a mechanical part last?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>When can we administer the next dose of medication?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>When will we get to our destination?</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Two common patterns are linear and exponential. The news is full of them.</p>
    <example>
      <blockquote>
        <p><em>Exponential gains in computing power, along with innovations in software, analytical techniques and the rise of Big Data, mean that many white-collar occupations are due for disruption by machines too. According to a 2013 study by two Oxford University professors, almost half of all jobs in the United States are susceptible to “computerization” over the coming decade or two.</em></p>
        <p><mdash/><q>How Efficiency Is Wiping Out the Middle Class</q>, <em>Another View</em> by David Diegel, New York Times January 25, 2017</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>In writing, <q><em>Exponential</em> gains in computing power</q> this article claims <em>computing power</em> is increasing by a constant percent. It must be assumed that the increases happen over equal time intervals, like every year or every <m>10</m> years for the claim to be valid.</p>
    </example>
    <example>
      <blockquote>
        <p><em>In 2012 the average rent was $<m>2,225</m>. Every year it has risen roughly a hundred dollars. But in late 2016, the rental market suddenly became flat.</em></p>
        <p><em><q>If I were to bet, I would bet that prices are on the way down. I would bet the tenants and buyers are going to have the upper hand probably for the next two or three years,</q> said real estate broker Peter Zalewski.</em></p>
        <p><mdash/><q>After Years Of Price Hikes, South Florida's Rental Market Entering New Era Of Decline</q>, David Sutta, CBS Miami, March 29, 2017</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>This article is reporting a pattern of constant rate of change (monthly rent). The real estate broker quoted in the article is using a linear model to predict the rental market for the next two or three years.</p>
    </example>
    <p>Distiguishing between linear and exponential patterns is as easy as knowing the difference between addition and multipication. The patterns allow us to find formulas for linear or exponential situations.</p>
    <p>A <term>linear pattern</term><index><main>linear pattern</main><sub>constant rate of change</sub></index> of constant rate of change is essentially repeated addition. A linear formula counts how many times you add the same number.</p>
    <p>An <term>exponential pattern</term><index><main>exponential</main><sub>pattern</sub></index> of constant percent change is essesntially repeated multiplication. An exponential formula counts how many times you multiply by the same number.</p>

    <title>A General Formula for Exponential Growth/Decay</title>
      <assemblage>
      <p>You will find the word <term>compounded</term> in the exercises that follow.</p>
      <p><term>Compounding</term><index><main>compounding</main></index> is the process of repeatedly increasing or decreasing by a percent. It refers to the fact that increasing or decreasing a number by a percent is really a change by a fraction that number.</p>
      <p>Therefore consecutive percent increase (or decrease) is always based on a fraction of a number that is already greater (or lesser) than the initial number.</p>
      <p>Compounding also tells us how often a percent change is calculated. For instance, if the percent interest on a loan is compounded monthly, it means interest is calculated every month. Compounded annually means interest is calculated each year, <init>etc.</init></p>
      <p>In the expression <m>500\cdot 1.15\cdot 1.15\cdot 1.15</m> the value <m>500</m> has been increased by <m>15 \%</m> compounded three times.</p>
      </assemblage>
      <p>A common form for a linear equation is <m>y = mx + b</m>, although there are others. Exponential equations have their own form too. In this part of the activity we use a table of values to find a pattern in constant percent growth or decay then find a form for exponential functions.</p>
      <p>To find a pattern within numerical data, it is best to record how we get our results instead of the results themselves.</p>
      <p>As a way to convince you, here is an experiment.</p>

      <todo>Write an "if" statement so that if NEXT1 is the actual value or "0" for "I don't know" then it is correct.</todo>

              <solution>
                  <p>Both patterns are exactly the same.  One shows the results and the other shows how to get the results.</p>
                  <p>Most likely you found the second pattern to be the easiest to predict because you can see <em>how</em> you got the answers.</p>
                  <p>The first pattern shows only the results, so all you see is numbers without any clue how they were found.</p>
                  <p>In each case the next value is <var name="$Next1" />, but in the second pattern you can predict the calculation to be <me>5\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot  + 5 = 165 </me></p>

      <p>Hopefully, you're convinced that finding a pattern in a sequence is much easier if you write out how you get each result instead of the actual result.</p>

            <p>Notice what is changing and what is not changing in the table.</p>
            <p>Every calculation is based on the initial amount, that does not change. Every calculation has multiples of <m>1.08</m>, that does not change either.</p>
            <p>However, the number of times <m>1.08</m> is repeated does change.  We have to figure out how the input numbers on the left affect the output values on the right.</p>
            <p>In this case the input is the same as the number of repeated <m>1.08</m> factors. This is not always the case.</p>
            <p>Notice how the formula <m>390(1.08)^{t}</m>shows what changes and what does not change.  The initial value and the growth factor are both constants.  The only thing that changes is the exponent which counts <em>how many</em> times the growth factor is repeated.</p>

      <p>Now we have general forms for both linear <me>y=mx+b</me> and exponential <me>y=ab^{x}</me> equations.</p>
      <p>In the linear equation <me>y=mx+b</me> the variable <m>b</m> is sometimes referred to as the initial value. On a graph it represents the vertical intercept while <m>m</m> represents the rate of change (slope). The rate of change tells us the rate of increase (or decrease) <em>per unit</em> input.</p>
      <p>The variable <m>x</m> counts how many times the rate of change is added to the initial value.</p>
      <p>In the exponential equation <me>y = ab^{x}</me> the initial value is represent by <m>a</m>, and <m>b</m> is the growth factor.</p>
      <p>The growth factor tells us the percent increase (or decrease) <em>per unit</em> input while the variable <m>x</m> in this case counts how many times the growth factor is multiplied.</p>
      <p>Finding the growth factor <em>per unit</em> in an exponential formula can be tricky. It may be we have been thinking in terms of constant rate of change (linear) for so long, we often think everything is linear.</p>
      <p>We need a way to convert a phrase like <q><m>60 \%</m> over <m>3</m> years</q> into one about the percent growth <em>per year</em>. A good start is to remind ourselves how repeated addition is different than repeated multiplication.</p>

    <title>Graphs of Exponential Functions</title>
    <p>To explore the graphs of exponential functions it may help to compare them to the graphs of linear functions since we already have some experience with them.</p>
    <p>In the following examples we track the position of an ant over time using both a linear model and an exponential model.</p>
    <exercise>
      <introduction>
        <p>An ant is intially <m>150</m> inches from a wall, and each minute it walks <m>25</m> inches towards the wall.</p>

    <p>Comparing linear and exponential graphs there are some clear differences.</p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
         <p>The linear function graphs as a staight line while the exponential function graphs as a concave-up curve.</p>
       </li>
       <li>
         <p>The linear function has a horizontal intercept, but the exponential fucntion appears not to touch the horizontal axis.</p>

    <p>Let's explore the graph of the exponential function more closely and return to the example of the ant moving towards a wall by reducing the distance by <m>25 \%</m> each minute.</p>

      <p>An ant initially <m>150</m> inches from a wall moves towards the wall by <m>25 \%</m> each minute.</p>
    </introduction>

          <statement>
            <p>The position of the ant as a function of time, t minutes, can be modeled with the equation <m>f(t)=150(0.75)^{t}</m></p>
            <p>Notice that decreasing by <m>25 \%</m> of the distance means <q>keeping</q> <m>75 \%</m> of the distance.</p>
            <p>Complete the table for various times. Round your answers to <m>3</m> decimal places.</p>

            <p>The points from the table are plotted on the graph of the function. Though it may seem like the graph eventually touches the horizontal axis, we know from the values in the table that it does not.</p>
            <p>In this case we say the horizontal axis is a <term>horizontal asymptote</term>.</p>
            <p>What is the equation for the horizontal axis (<init>i.e.</init> a line that is zero units high)?</p>
            <p>The equation is <m>y = </m> <var name="0" width="4" /></p>

            <p>The equation of the horizontal asymptote (the x-axis) is <m>y=0</m></p>

    <p>All exponential functions (of this form) have horizontal asymptotes.  The equation for a horizontal asymptote is <m>y=k</m> where <m>k</m> is the height of the horizontal line the function approaches.</p>
    <p>In the last example the function decreases to near zero, so <m>y=0</m> is the equation of the horizontal asymptote.</p>
