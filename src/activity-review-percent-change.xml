    <title>Meaning of Percent and its Decimal Equivalent</title>
    <p><term>Percent</term><index><main>percent</main></index> literally means <q>for every <m>100</m></q>. So <m>15 \%</m> means <q>15 for every 100</q>.</p>
    <p>In order to use a percent in calculations, we must change the percent number into a decimal number. For instance, in order to use the expression <m>15 \%</m> in a calculation we must convert it into the decimal number <m>0.15</m> .</p>
    <p> The decimal number <m>0.15</m> is called the <term>decimal equivalent</term><index><main>decimal equivalent</main></index> of <m>15 \%</m>. In fact, the decimal equivalent of any percent value is that value divided by 100.</p>
    <p>In the future we will use the variable <m>r</m> to represent the decimal equivalent of a percent.</p>
    <me>
        r = \frac{\text{Pecent Value}}{100}
    </me>

  <title>Growth Factor: Percent Increase (<m>b \gt 1</m>)</title>
  <p>When someone gets a <m>10 \%</m> raise it means that their salary was divided into pieces and one of those pieces is added onto the original salary. Since <m>10 \% </m> has a decimal equivalent of <m>0.10</m> the increase (raise) means <m>0.10</m> of their salary is added back onto their original.</p>
  <p>Think of it like this</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>New Salary = Old Salary + <m>0.10 \cdot </m> Old Salary</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>If we let <m>N</m> represent the new salary and <m>s</m> represent the old salary then we can short-cut all the words and we can write a <q>math sentence</q> instead. You know, because this is a math book.</p>
  <md>
    <mrow>N \amp= s + 0.1s</mrow>
  </md>
  <p>Notice when we look at the statement as an equation, the variable <m>s</m> is factor of both terms on the right.  Therefore <m>s</m> can be factored out and the equation can be rewritten as</p>
  <md>
    <mrow>N \amp= (1 + 0.1)s</mrow>
    <mrow>N \amp= 1.1s</mrow>
  </md>
  <p>We are now able to think of a <m>10 \%</m> increase as multiplying by <m>1.1</m>  where the <m>1</m> represents the <m>100 \%</m> you already had and the <m>0.1</m> represents the <m>10 \%</m> increase.</p>
  <p>In the equation <me>N = 1.1s</me> the number <q><m>1.1</m></q> is called the growth factor and is usually denoted with letter <m>b</m>.</p>
  <p>A <term>growth factor</term><index><main>growth factor</main></index> is the number we use to multiply in order to get a percent increase or percent decrease. Unfortunately, it is somewhat confusing to refer to this number as a <q>growth</q> factor because we use it for both increasing and decreasing by a percent. Although sometimes you may see it written as a <q>decay</q> factor to specifically refer to a percent decrease.</p>
  <p>In our salary example multiplying by the growth factor <m>b = 1.1</m> makes the initial value <m>s</m> bigger by <m>10 \%</m>.</p>
  <p>In general, for percent increase the growth factor is defined as</p>
  <me>b = 1 + r</me>
  <p>Notice a percent increase means the growth factor is greater than <m>1</m> (<m>b \gt 1)</m>.</p>

  <p>We should now be able to use the growth factor to increase a value by a percent and we should be able to determine the percent growth between two values by calculating the growh factor and extracting the percent change.</p>

<subsection>
  <title>Growth Factor: Percent Decrease (<m>0 \lt b \lt 1</m>)</title>
  <p>Just like something can increase by a percent, it is also possible to decrease by a percent.</p>
  <p>Complete the following example to determine on your own how to decrease a value by a percent.</p>
  <example>
  <p>A pair of shorts on sale for <q><m>15 \%</m> off</q>.</p>
  <exercise>
    <webwork>
      <stage>
        <statement>
          <p>A price reduction of <m>15 \%</m> means the price of the shorts is divided into pieces and one of those pieces is subtracted from the original price of the shorts.</p>
          <p>To reduce the price by <m>15 \%</m> we must turn the percent value into its decimal equivalent.</p>    
          <p>The decimal equivalent of <m>15 \%</m> is <m>r = </m> <var name="0.15" width="4" /></p>
        </statement>
      </stage>
      <stage>
        <statement>
          <p>Therefore the sale price of the shorts is </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>New Price = Old Price <m>-</m> <m>0.15</m> * Old Price</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>If we let <m>N</m> represent the new price and <m>p</m> represent the old price we can write</p>
          <md>
            <mrow>N = p - 0.15p</mrow>
          </md>
          <p>Notice that <m>p</m> is a common factor in both terms on the right</p>
          <p>Factor out the common factor of p to isolate the growth factor. Rewrite the equation <m>N = p - 0.15p</m> as the growth factor times <m>p</m></p>
          <p><m>N =</m> <var name="0.85" width="4" /> \cdot  <m>p</m> </p>
        </statement>
      </stage>
      <stage>
        <statement>
          <p>A <m>15 \%</m> reduction in price means to multiply the original price by <var name="0.85" width="5"/>.</p>
          <p>Notice that the growth factor is <em>less than <m>1</m></em>. It is the fraction of the price we actually pay. Paying <m>85 \%</m> of the original price means a discount of <m>15 \%</m></p>
        </statement>
      </stage>
    </webwork>
  </exercise>
</example>
  <p>Notice that our price reduction was achieved by multipying by a growth factor <m>b \lt 1</m>.</p>
  <p>Something we need to consider about a percent decrease is, <q>How much can we decrease?</q></p>
  <p>Let's think about that for a moment.</p>
  <p>If you have 10 apples, you can eat <m>50 \%</m> of them, that's half the apples.  You can eat <m>75 \%</m> of them, that's <m>7 \frac{1}{2}</m> apples.  You can even eat all the apples, that's <m>100 \%</m> of the apples!</p>
  <p>But, can you eat more than all the apples you have? <em>Hint: If you only have <m>10</m> apples, you cannot eat more than <m>10</m> apples</em></p>
  <p>It is not possible to decrease by more than <m>100 \%</m> of what you have.</p>
  <p>Therefore when it comes to a percent loss, the growth factor is less than <m>1</m> for sure, but it cannot be less than <m>0</m>.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, since multiplying by zero is zero, it makes the <q>growth</q> very uninteresting.  From now on, a growth factor is always strictly greater than zero.</p>
  <p>The only choices are <m>b</m> is greater than <m>1</m> or <m>b</m> is between <m>0</m> and <m>1</m></p>
  <p>In math we say</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Percent growth means <m>b \gt 1</m></p>
    <p>Percent decay means <m>0 \lt b \lt 1</m></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Let's finish this activity by putting together some of the skills we have reviewed thus far.</p>

  <p>Consider a study on the reduction of asthma.</p>
  <example>
  <p>In a study of 658 adults, most of whom had mild to moderate asthma, reviewers found that oral vitamin D supplements ranging from 400 to 4,000 units a day reduced the risk of attacks requiring medication by 37 percent.</p>
