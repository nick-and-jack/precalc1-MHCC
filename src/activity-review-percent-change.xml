    <title>Meaning of Percent and its Decimal Equivalent</title>
    <p>
      <term>Percent</term>
          <idx><h>percent</h></idx>
      literally means <q>for every <m>100</m></q>.
      So <m>15 \%</m> means <q>15 for every 100</q>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In order to use a percent in calculations,
      we must change the percent number into a decimal number.
      For instance,
      in order to use the expression <m>15 \%</m> in a calculation we must convert it into the decimal number <m>0.15</m> .
    </p>

    <p>
      The decimal number <m>0.15</m> is called the
      <term>decimal equivalent</term>
          <idx><h>decimal equivalent</h></idx>
      of <m>15 \%</m>.
      In fact, the decimal equivalent of any percent value is that value divided by 100.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the future we will use the variable <m>r</m> to represent the decimal equivalent of a percent.
      <me>
        r = \frac{\text{Percent Value}}{100}
      </me>
    </p>

            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>0.5 \%</m> has a decimal equivalent of <m>r = \frac{0.5}{100} = 0.005</m>

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>5 \%</m> has a decimal equivalent of <m>r = \frac{5}{100} = 0.05</m>
            </p>

  <subsection>
    <title>Growth Factor: Percent Increase (<m>b \gt 1</m>)</title>
    <p>
      When someone gets a <m>10 \%</m> raise it means that their salary was divided into pieces and one of those pieces is added onto the original salary.
      Since <m>10 \% </m> has a decimal equivalent of <m>0.10</m> the increase (raise) means <m>0.10</m> of their salary is added back onto their original.
    </p>

    <p>
      Think of it like this
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        New Salary = Old Salary + <m>0.10 \cdot </m> Old Salary
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      If we let <m>N</m> represent the new salary and <m>s</m> represent the old salary then we can short-cut all the words and we can write a
      <q>math sentence</q> instead.
      You know, because this is a math book.
      <md>
        <mrow>N \amp= s + 0.1s</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      Notice when we look at the statement as an equation,
      the variable <m>s</m> is factor of both terms on the right.
      Therefore <m>s</m> can be factored out and the equation can be rewritten as
      <md>
        <mrow>N \amp= (1 + 0.1)s</mrow>
        <mrow>N \amp= 1.1s</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      We are now able to think of a <m>10 \%</m> increase as multiplying by <m>1.1</m> where the <m>1</m> represents the <m>100 \%</m> you already had and the <m>0.1</m> represents the <m>10 \%</m> increase.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the equation
      <me>
        N = 1.1s
      </me>
      the number <q><m>1.1</m></q> is called the growth factor and is usually denoted with letter <m>b</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      A <term>growth factor</term>
          <idx><h>growth factor</h></idx>
      is the number we use to multiply in order to get a percent increase or percent decrease.
      Unfortunately,
      it is somewhat confusing to refer to this number as a <q>growth</q>
      factor because we use it for both increasing and decreasing by a percent.
      Although sometimes you may see it written as a <q>decay</q>
      factor to specifically refer to a percent decrease.
    </p>

    <p>
      In our salary example multiplying by the growth factor <m>b = 1.1</m> makes the initial value <m>s</m> bigger by <m>10 \%</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In general, for percent increase the growth factor is defined as
      <me>
        b = 1 + r
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Notice a percent increase means the growth factor is greater than <m>1</m> (<m>b \gt 1)</m>.

    <title>Growth Factor: Percent Decrease (<m>0 \lt b \lt 1</m>)</title>
    <p>
      Just like something can increase by a percent,
      it is also possible to decrease by a percent.
    </p>

    <p>
      Complete the following example to determine on your own how to decrease a value by a percent.
    </p>

    <exercise>

      <introduction>
        <p>
          A pair of shorts on sale for <q><m>15 \%</m> off</q>.
        </p>
      </introduction>

      <webwork>
          <stage>
          <statement>
            <p>
              A price reduction of <m>15 \%</m> means the price of the shorts is divided into pieces and one of those pieces is subtracted from the original price of the shorts.
            </p>

            <p>
              To reduce the price by <m>15 \%</m> we must turn the percent value into its decimal equivalent.
            </p>

            <p>
              The decimal equivalent of <m>15 \%</m> is <m>r = </m> <var name="0.15" width="4" />
            </p>
          </statement>
          </stage>
          <stage>
          <statement>
            <p>
              Therefore the sale price of the shorts is
              <me>
                \text{New Price} = \text{Old Price} -0.15\cdot(\text{Old Price})
              </me>
              If we let <m>N</m> represent the new price and <m>p</m> represent the old price we can write
              <md>
                <mrow>N = p - 0.15p</mrow>
              </md>
            </p>

            <p>
              Notice that <m>p</m> is a common factor in both terms on the right
            </p>

            <p>
              Factor out the common factor of p to isolate the growth factor.
              Rewrite the equation <m>N = p - 0.15p</m> as the growth factor times <m>p</m>
            </p>

            <p>
              <m>N =</m> <var name="0.85" width="4" /> \cdot <m>p</m>
            </p>
          </statement>
          </stage>
          <stage>
          <statement>
            <p>
              A <m>15 \%</m> reduction in price means to multiply the original price by <var name="0.85" width="5"/>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Notice that the growth factor is
              <em>less than <m>1</m></em>.
              It is the fraction of the price we actually pay.
              Paying <m>85 \%</m> of the original price means a discount of <m>15 \%</m>
            </p>
          </statement>
          </stage>
      </webwork>
    </exercise>

    <p>
      Notice that our price reduction was achieved by multiplying by a growth factor <m>b \lt 1</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Something we need to consider about a percent decrease is,
      <q>How much can we decrease?</q>
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's think about that for a moment.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you have 10 apples,
      you can eat <m>50 \%</m> of them, that's half the apples.
      You can eat <m>75 \%</m> of them,
      that's <m>7 \frac{1}{2}</m> apples.
      You can even eat all the apples,
      that's <m>100 \%</m> of the apples!
    </p>

    <p>
      But, can you eat more than all the apples you have?
      <em>Hint:
      If you only have <m>10</m> apples,
      you cannot eat more than <m>10</m> apples</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      It is not possible to decrease by more than <m>100 \%</m> of what you have.
    </p>

    <p>
      Therefore when it comes to a percent loss,
      the growth factor is less than <m>1</m> for sure,
      but it cannot be less than <m>0</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Furthermore, since multiplying by zero is zero,
      it makes the <q>growth</q> very uninteresting.
      From now on,
      a growth factor is always strictly greater than zero.
    </p>

    <p>
      The only choices are <m>b</m> is greater than <m>1</m> or <m>b</m> is between <m>0</m> and <m>1</m>
    </p>

    <p>
      In math we say
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Percent growth means <m>b \gt 1</m>
      </p>

      <p>
        Percent decay means <m>0 \lt b \lt 1</m>
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>

                  <p>
                    Where <m>r</m> is the decimal equivalent of the percent we are looking for.
                    Solving this equation for <m>r</m> we get
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <m>r = \frac{4{,}000}{400} - 1</m>
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <m>r = 9</m>
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    This represents a <m>900 \%</m> increase.
