      <title>Gist of Vertical and Horizontal Translations</title>
      <paragraphs>
        <p>To <term>transform</term> a function means to change it <mdash /> either its <term>input</term> or its <term>output</term>. If the change is only in position (the graph looks the same, but is in a different location) the change is called a <term>translation</term>.</p>
        <p>In this chapter we learn how to translate a graph or a table of values. This will involve adding or subtracting values to the input and/or the output of a function's formula.</p>
        <p>It will be important for us to distinguish between the input and the output of a function. For instance, we must understand that the function <me>f(x) = x^2 - 5x</me>
        has an input <m>x</m> and an output <m>f(x)</m>.</p>
        <p>If the input is changed to <m>x−3</m>, then the output would be <m>f(x−3)</m>. If the input is changed to <m>w + 1</m>, the output would be <m>f(w+1)</m>.</p>
        <p>We must also remember how a formula works. For example, if you put <m>x</m> into a formula, then the formula will have <m>x</m>’s in it. But if you substitute <m>x–3</m> into a formula, then it will have <m>(x-3)</m>’s in it.</p>
        <p>Therefore, for the function <m>f(x) = x^2 - 5x</m>, we would have: <md><mrow>f(x−3) = (x−3)^2 − 5(x−3)</mrow></md> and <md><mrow>f(w+1) = (w+1)^2 − 5(w+1)</mrow></md></p>
      </paragraphs>
      <paragraphs>
        <p>Now what does changing the input do to the <em>graph</em> of <m>f(x)</m>? It turns out that subtracting <m>3</m> from the input would move the graph of <m>f</m> to the right by <m>3</m> units, or adding <m>1</m> to the input would move the graph to the left by <m>1</m> unit. This is called a horizontal <term>translation</term> (or horizontal <term>shift</term>).</p>
        <p>In short:
            <blockquote>Adding a number to the input will shift the graph to the <em>left</em>.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>Subtracting a number from the input will shift the graph to the <em>right</em>.</blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>In fact, whenever you do anything to the input of a function, the result is some kind of horizontal change to the graph. In this section, we see that adding to the input will produce a horizontal translation of the graph to the left or the right.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, if you make changes to the outside of the function, it will affect the graph <em>vertically</em>. In this section, we see that adding or subtracting from the output will produce a vertical translation of the graph up or down.</p>
        <p>In short:
            <blockquote>Adding a number to the ouput will shift the graph <em>up</em>.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>Subtracting a number from the output will shift the graph <em>down</em>.</blockquote>
        </p>

      <p>In the next three exercises, you will use a verbal description of a transformation in order to write a formula, and then use the formula for a transformation to provide a verbal description.</p>
      <exercise>
        <statement>
          <p>The function <m>f(x) = x^2 + 2x</m> is graphed below.</p>

          <p>If you wanted to move this graph so it had the same shape, but it was <m>3</m> units to the right and <m>2</m> units down, what would be its formula?</p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>To move the graph to the right by <m>3</m> units, you must subtract <m>3</m> from the input.</p>
          <p>To move it down <m>2</m> unit, you must subtract <m>2</m> from the output.</p>
        </hint>
        <answer>
          <p>The function should be: <me>f(x-3) - 2 = (x-3)^2 + 2(x-3) - 2</me></p>
          <p>Remember to substitute <m>(x-3)</m> in wherever <m>x</m> appears in the original formula, and then subtract <m>2</m> at the end.</p>

            <p>Notice that <md>
              <mrow>h(x) \amp= (x+1) - (x+1)^3 + 2</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp= g(x+1)+2</mrow></md></p>
        </hint>
        <answer>
            <p>Using <m>(x+1)</m> in place of <m>x</m> will shift the graph to the <em>left</em> by <m>1</m> unit, and adding <m>2</m> to the outside of the function will shift the graph <em>up</em> by <m>2</m> units.</p>

                <p>A straightforward way to sketch the transformed function is to take a known point from <m>g(x)</m>, such as <m>(0,0)</m>, and move it left <m>1</m> and up <m>2</m>. Then sketch the rest of the graph around that new point.</p>

            <p>With this, you should be able to describe how far the graph of <m>f(x)</m> was moved <em>left</em> or <em>right</em>. This will correspond to adding a number to the <em>input</em> of the function.</p>
            <p>Then, describe how far <em>up</em> or <em>down</em> the graph of <m>f(x)</m> was moved. This will correspond to adding a number to the output of the function.</p>
            <p>Then, you should be able to use function notation of the form <me>f(x + h) + k</me> to write the transformation.</p>
          </hint>
          <solution>
            <p>The graph of <m>f(x)</m> was shifted to the <em>right</em> by <m>2</m> units, and <em>down</em> by <m>1</m>. Subtracting <m>2</m> from the input and <m>1</m> from the output gives us: <md>
              <mrow>y \amp= f(x-2) - 1</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp= 5\left|x-2\right| - (x-2)^2 - 1</mrow></md></p>

      <paragraphs><title>Translations in context</title>
      <p>Of course, translations should do more for us than just provide a quick way to move graphs around. If a function describes something about a real object or situation, then knowing about changes to that object should help us alter the function to account for those changes.</p>
