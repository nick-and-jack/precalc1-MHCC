    <title>Average Rate of Change</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>In this activity we introduce the math symbol <m>\Delta</m> that represents change and we develop the concept of <em>average rate of change</em></p>

        <p>It will be helpful to remember that the speed of an object is defined as the distance the object travels divided by the time it takes to travel that distance.</p>

        <p>After completing this lesson you will be able to:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Perform calculations using function notation including Average Rate of Change.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>The prerequisites for this lesson are knowing how to calculate the slope of a line and understanding the meaning of slope.</p>
    </introduction>
    
    <subsection>
        <p>Let's start by realizing you already understand the concept of <em>average rate of change</em> but maybe you have never hear the phrase before.</p>

                <todo>Alex! Insert here: from Maple acitivity "ACT02_average_rate_of_change", question #4 - "Use function notation to write and expression that represents the change in distance between the 2nd and the 5th hours." The answer needs to accept any spacing issues a student may have when typing in their response "f(5) - f(1)".</todo>
