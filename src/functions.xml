    <conclusion>
    <p>A <term>function</term> is a rule that may be in the form of a graph, or a table of values or a formula.  It may even be a sentence or a set of instructions.  A function takes an input value and uses the rule to create an output value.</p>

    <p>Function notation looks like this: <m>f(\text{input})=\text{output}</m></p>

    <p>But, instead of writing the words <q>input</q> and <q>output</q> we usually use variables, like x and y. Then we define in words what the variables actually mean or represent.  Most often the notation will look something like this: <m>f(x)=y</m>
</p>

    <p>Inside the parentheses is the <term>Independent Variable</term>, like <m>x</m>, and outside the parentheses, on the other side of the equals sign, is the <term>Dependent Variable</term>, like <m>y</m>.</p>

<!--
Add a few webwork problems here for the terms "function", "independent variable" and "dependent variable".
    1.  Suppose <m>f</m> is the rule that takes the area of a circle as its input and then outputs the radius of the circle.
        (a) What is the correct way to write this rule in function notation?
            Options:  f(radius) = area, f(area) = radius
        (b) Which is the dependent variable?
            Options:  Area, Radius
        (c) In the equation <m>f(100) \approx 5.64</m>, what is a possible meaning for the number 100?
            Options:  100 ft, 100 ft^2, 100 ft^3
    2.  The function <m>h(y) = 24 + 18y</m> would find the height (in inches) of a Paper Birch tree which is <m>24</m> inches tall when it is planted, and grows by 18 inches per year. The independent variable <m>y</m> is the number of years after it is planted.
        (a) What is the value of <m>h(3)</m>, including the correct units?
        (b) For the equation <m>h(2) = 60</m>, choose the correct interpretation below:
            Options: The tree has been growing for 2 years and is now 60 feet tall, The tree has been growing for 60 months and is now 2 feet tall, The tree has been growing for 2 years and is now 60 inches tall, The tree has been growing for 2 months and is now 60 inches tall.

    <example>
        <p>Let <m>E</m> be the fuel efficiency, in miles per gallon, of a car traveling at <m>s</m> miles per hour. For speeds between 5 and 75 miles per hour, the function in <xref ref="speed-vs-efficiency"/> tells us the efficiency of the car.</p>

        <figure xml:id="speed-vs-efficiency">
            <caption>Fuel Economy versus Speed</caption>
            <image>
                <latex-image-code>
                    <![CDATA[\begin{tikzpicture}
                    \begin{axis}[ymin=0, ymax=35, xlabel={Speed (mph)}, ylabel={Fuel Economy (mpg)}, minor xtick={5,10,...,75}, ytick={0,10,...,30}, minor ytick={0,5,...,35}, xmin=5, xmax=75, grid=both, axis background/.style={fill=yellow!40}]
                    \addplot[smooth, thick, color=red] coordinates {(5, 11) (10, 19) (15, 24) (20, 26.5) (25, 28) (30,29) (35, 29.5) (40, 30) (55, 30.5) (65,26.5) (70, 25) (75, 24)};
                    \end{axis}
                    \end{tikzpicture}]]>
                </latex-image-code>
            </image>
        </figure>

        <p>Therefore, the <em>efficiency is a function of the speed</em>. Using function notation we could write an equation saying the same thing: <m>E=f(s)</m></p>

        <p>The input is the speed, <m>s</m>, and the output is the efficiency, <m>E</m>.</p>

        <p>The efficiency of the car is given by the height of the graph.  Therefore <m>f(35) = 28</m> means, <q>The efficiency of the car traveling at <quantity><mag>35</mag><unit base="mileperhour"/></quantity> is 28 mpg</q>.</p>
    </example>

    <paragraphs>
        <title>Inputs have unique outputs</title>
        <p>An important property of functions is that any single input value can only have one output value. For instance, the car can only have one efficiency at a given speed. The car cannot get 10 mpg and 20 mpg simultaneously.</p>
<!--    Note: This could be the case if the car was driven in different gears, or if it was driven up-hill vs. down-hill. Is this important to point out?
-->
        <p>However, it is possible there are multiple inputs that give you the same output.  From the graph we see that a fuel efficiency of 25 mpg can be attained by traveling at a speed of about <quantity><mag>20</mag><unit base="mileperhour"/></quantity> and also at about <quantity><mag>70</mag><unit base="mileperhour"/></quantity>.</p>
    </paragraphs>
<!--
Add a webwork problem here for the "well-defined" part of the definition.
    1.  Suppose <m>f</m> is a function. Which of the following situations is possible?
        Options:  <m>f(3) = 5</m> and <m>f(10) = 5</m>, <m>f(3) = 5</m> and <m>f(3) = 7</m>

    <paragraphs>
        <title>Describing functions with intervals.</title>
            <p>A function may have many different characteristics: Its output values may increase or decrease, its graph may curve up or curve down, it may have positive outputs or negative outputs. When describing these characteristics for a function, we typically refer to an <term>interval</term> (connected part) of the input axis, or a particular value of the input where something interesting occurs.</p>
            <p>Using our efficiency example, the fuel efficiency increases (goes up) between <quantity><mag>5</mag></quantity> and <quantity><mag>55</mag><unit base="mileperhour"/></quantity> then decreases (goes down) for speeds between <quantity><mag>55</mag></quantity> and <quantity><mag>75</mag><unit base="mileperhour"/></quantity>. Also, the efficiency is lowest at about <quantity><mag>5</mag><unit base="mileperhour"/></quantity> and highest at about <quantity><mag>55</mag><unit base="mileperhour"/></quantity>. </p>
            <p>Any connected portion of the horizontal (speed) axis or the vertical (efficiency) axis is called an <term>interval</term>.  It is important to be able to correctly describe an interval.</p>
            <p>We could use an <term>inequality</term> to describe the interval where the efficiency function is increasing: <m>5\lt s\lt55</m>.  This means that as the car's speed changes from <quantity><mag>5</mag></quantity> to <quantity><mag>55</mag><unit base="mileperhour"/></quantity>, the efficiency is increasing.</p>
            <p>Another characteristic we can describe with inequalities is the <term>concavity</term> of a function. We say a function is <term>concave up</term> if its graph curves upward from left to right, and that it is <term>concave down</term> if it curves downward from left to right. We can see that the efficiency graph is:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><p>concave down for <m>5\lt s\lt60</m>.</p></li>
                <li><p>concave up for <m>60\lt s\lt75</m>.</p></li>
            </ul>
    </paragraphs>

    <paragraphs>
        <title>Evaluating vs. Solving.</title>

        <p>The word <term>Evaluate</term> means to use a known input value to find the output value. Evaluating a function looks like this:<me>f(25)</me>It means, <q>Find the result of choosing <quantity><mag>25</mag><unit base="mileperhour"/></quantity></q> as the input. The expression <m>f(25)</m> represents the output <m>27</m>, which we can see from the graph.</p>
        <p><term>Solve</term> means the output is already known and we are trying to find all the possible inputs that give us that output. These input values are called <term>solutions</term> of the equation. For instance, we may be asked to <me>\text{Solve }f(s)=25</me>This means that we are to find all input values (solutions) that would give us the output <m>25</m>.</p>
        <p>Using the graph of the efficiency function, we see that the equation <m>f(s)=25</m> has two solutions:  <m>s = 20</m> and <m>s = 70</m>.</p>
<!--
Add a webwork problem for these key terms:
    <p>The graph below shows a graph of the function <m>T(F) = C</m>, where <m>F</m> is temperature in degrees Fahrenheit, and <m>C</m> is temperature in degrees Celsius.</p>
    <p>Use the graph to answer each question below.</p>
    (a) Evaluate T(77)
    (b) Solve T(F) = -22

        <title>Average Rate of Change</title>
        <p>This a <em>very</em> important topic of this course. You will see it over and over again in various forms. Basically it means slope, but it's more than that. It's also a notation and a concept that sets the stage for calculus.</p>
        <p>From the car's efficiency function we know <m>f(5)=10</m> which means at <quantity><mag>5</mag><unit base="mileperhour"/></quantity> the efficiency is <quantity><mag>10</mag><unit base="mile-per-gallon"/></quantity>.</p>
        <p>We also know that <m>f(25)=27</m> which means at <quantity><mag>25</mag><unit base="mileperhour"/></quantity> the efficiency is <quantity><mag>27</mag><unit base="mile-per-gallon"/></quantity>.</p>
        <p>Therefore, as the speed increased from <quantity><mag>5</mag><unit base="mileperhour"/></quantity> to <quantity><mag>25</mag><unit base="mileperhour"/></quantity>, the car's efficiency increased from <quantity><mag>10</mag><unit base="mile-per-gallon"/></quantity> to <quantity><mag>27</mag><unit base="mile-per-gallon"/></quantity>. On average the efficiency changed by <quantity><mag>17</mag><unit base="mile-per-gallon"/></quantity> while the speed changed by <quantity><mag>20</mag><unit base="mileperhour"/></quantity>.</p>
        <p>We can use this information to calculate the average increase in efficiency over the increase in speed.</p>
        <p>Using function notation we write <md>
            <mrow>\frac{\Delta f}{\Delta s}\amp=\frac{27-10}{25-5}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp=0.85</mrow></md>The number <m>0.85</m> (notice it is positive) means that between speeds of <quantity><mag>5</mag><unit base="mileperhour"/></quantity> and <quantity><mag>25</mag><unit base="mileperhour"/></quantity>, the car's efficiency is increasing at an average rate of <quantity><mag>0.85</mag><unit base="milepergallon"/></quantity> per <quantity><mag>1</mag><unit base="mileperhour"/></quantity>.</p>
        <p>The little triangle symbol <m>\Delta</m> is also very important. It means, <q>Change in</q>. Therefore <m>\Delta f</m> means <q>change in efficiency</q> and <m>\Delta s</m> means <q>change in speed</q>. Together the symbol <m>\frac{\Delta f}{\Delta s}</m> is called <q>average rate of change</q>.</p>

                <p>Below is a table of data and corresponding graph of the fuel efficiency of a midsize car (<quantity><unit base="milepergallon"/></quantity>) as a function of the speed of the car (<quantity><unit base="mileperhour"/></quantity>). Each point on the graph is an ordered pair (speed vs. fuel efficiency). If the car travels at 15 <quantity><unit base="mileperhour"/></quantity>, the fuel efficiency is about 15.3 <quantity><unit base="milepergallon"/></quantity>. If the car changes speed, then the fuel efficiency changes.</p>

                <p>Place one dot at the ordered pair <m>(15, 15.3)</m>. Place the other dot at the ordered pair <m>(25, 29)</m>. Notice as the input changes from <m>15</m> to <m>25</m> (from one dot to the other), the output changes from <m>15.3</m> to <m>29</m>.</p>

                <p>Let <m>m</m> be the slope of the line between the two points.  Notice the slope of the line is <m>m = 1.37</m>.  It turns out <q>average rate of change</q> is just the slope!</p>
