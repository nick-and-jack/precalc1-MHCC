    <title>Student Learning Outcomes</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        In this activity, we will explore how to <term>transform</term>
        the graph of a function <m>f</m> by making changes to its formula in the following ways:
        <m>f(x) + k</m> and <m>f(x + h)</m>.
        By the end of this activity, you will be able to:
      </p>
    </introduction>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Recognize the geometric effect of transforming <m>f(x)</m> to <m>f(x) + k</m> and <m>f(x + h)</m>.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Write the formula for a basic function which has been changed by these transformations.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Sketch the graph of a basic function which has been changed by these transformations.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </objectives>

  <subsection>
    <title>Prep Activity</title>
    <p>
      In preparation for this activity,
      we should revisit function evaluation with an eye toward describing changes to the input or the output.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each of the following problems involves something you have already learned.
      These are skills we will need in the rest of this activity.

      For any function <m>y = f(x)</m>,
      remember that <m>x</m>-values are inputs,
      and <m>y</m>-values are outputs.
      If we change this equation to
      <me>
        y = f(x)+10
      </me>
      then we are really just adding the number <m>10</m> to all of the outputs for the original function <m>f</m>.

    <p>

      you will describe changes to either the input or the output of a function.

    <title>The Swimmer</title>
    <p>
      In this section,
      we will see the effects of changing the input or the output of a function,
      particularly as relates to the graph.
      We will follow a single story that will lead us through most of the main points of this section.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          In preparation for the swimming competition,
          a swimmer jumped off a diving board into a swimming pool below.
          Below is a graph of her height above the water as a function of time.

      Now more information about that first dive:
      The formula for the swimmer's height above the water after diving off the regular board is given by:
      <me>
        h = f(t) = -16t^2+15t+3
      </me>
      (You are not expected to know how this formula was made.)
    </p>

    <p>
      Confirm that this formula really works by graphing it on your calculator.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the next exercise,
      you will change this formula so it represents the swimmer's height when she used the high-dive board.

      On the day of the swimming competition,
      our swimmer was standing on the regular (<m>3</m> foot) diving board,
      waiting for the starting whistle.
      However, she was thinking so hard about her math class
      (which she <em>loves</em>),
      that she missed the sound of the whistle,
      and ended up jumping off the board <m>2</m> seconds late!
      See the next exercise.

                    The formula that moves the graph of

    <p>
      It may have surprised you to see that shifting the graph to the <em>right</em>
      corresponded to <em>subtracting</em> a number from the input.
      To make sense of this,
      consider one of the other swimmers in the competition who jumped when the whistle sounded.
      Their height function would be given by <m>h = f(t)</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If we wanted to find our swimmer's height at, say,
      <m>3</m> seconds after the whistle sounded,
      it would be the same height as this other swimmer had at only <m>1</m> second after the whistle <mdash /> everything for our swimmer happened <m>2</m> seconds late.
      In other words,
      to find our swimmer's height after <m>t</m> seconds,
      this is the same as the other swimmer had <m>2</m> seconds before.
      So for our swimmer, her height is given by:
      <me>
        h = f(t - 2)
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      The next two exercises will complete our story about the swimmer.
      In them, you will write formulas for her height given different diving situations.

              Suppose the swimmer jumped off the high-dive board,

      Finally, we will see an application of using vertical and horizontal shifts to quickly perform a familiar task:
      Finding the equation of a line

      <webwork>

            <pg-code>
                $formulas=PopUp(["?","y=4(x+7)+15","y=4(x+7)-15","y=4(x-7)+15","y=4(x-7)-15"],3);

              The linear function
              <me>
                f(x) = 4x
              </me>
              will graph as a line with slope <m>4</m>,
              passing through the origin <m>(0,0)</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Now, using translations,
              it would be easy to write the equations of similar lines.
              For example:
            </p>

            <p>
              The line with slope <m>4</m>,
              passing through the point <m>(7,15)</m>,
              may be thought of as the result of shifting <m>f(x)</m> to the
              <em>right</em> by <m>7</m> units,
              and <em>up</em> by <m>15</m> units.
            </p>

            <p>
              [In this case,
              we are focusing our attention on moving the old point <m>(0,0)</m> to the new point <m>(7,15)</m>.]
            </p>

            <p>
              What would be the equation of this new line?
            </p>

            <p>
              <var name="$formulas" form="popup" />
            </p>
          </statement>
          <hint>
            <p>
              Since <m>f(x)</m> has the point <m>(0,0)</m>,
              think about shifting that point to <m>(7,15)</m>.
              Remember that adding to the <em>input</em>
              will move the graph to the left,
              and subtracting from the input will move the graph to the right.

              Without doing any simplification to the formula, the line would be:
              <md>
                <mrow>y \amp= f(x-7) + 15</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp= 4(x-7) + 15</mrow>

                @a=map{1+$_}NchooseK(8,2);
                $whichLine=Compute("11*(x-$a[0])-$a[1]");

          <statement>
            <p>
              The line with slope <m>11</m>,
              passing through the origin <m>(0,0)</m>, has the equation:
              <me>
                f(x) = 11x
              </me>
            </p>

            <p>
              Using translations,
              write the equation for the line with slope <m>11</m>,
              passing through the point <m>(<var name="$a[0]" />,-<var name="$a[1]" />)</m>.
            </p>

              Think of moving the point <m>(0,0)</m> to the point <m>(<var name="$a[0]" />,-<var name="$a[1]" />)</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              We would shift the graph to the right by <var name="$a[0]" /> units and down by <var name="$a[1]" /> units,
              and the equation would be:
              <m>y = 11(x - <var name="$a[0]" />) - <var name="$a[1]" /></m>

            <p>
              The equation of a line with slope <m>m</m>,
              passing through the origin, is just:
              <me>
                y = mx
              </me>
            </p>

            <p>
              If we wanted to change this line so it had the same slope but passed through the point <m>(a,b)</m>,
              what would be the equation?
            </p>

              This is a very useful formula for writing the equation of a line if you know the slope and any single point on its graph.
              This formula is called the <term>Point-Slope</term> formula for a line.
