        <title>Student Learning Outcomes</title>
        <introduction>
            <p>In this activity, we will explore how to <term>transform</term> the graph of a function <m>f</m> by making changes to its formula in the following ways: <m>f(x) + k</m> and <m>f(x + h)</m>. By the end of this activity, you will be able to:</p>
        </introduction>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Recognize the geometric effect of transforming <m>f(x)</m> to <m>f(x) + k</m> and <m>f(x + h)</m>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Write the formula for a basic function which has been changed by these transformations.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Sketch the graph of a basic function which has been changed by these transformations.</p>

        </ul>
    </objectives>

    <subsection>
        <title>Prep Activity</title>
        <p>In preparation for this activity, we should revisit function evaluation with an eye toward describing changes to the input or the output.</p>

        <p>Each of the following problems involves something you have already learned. These are skills we will need in the rest of this activity.</p>

        <p>For any function <m>y = f(x)</m>, remember that <m>x</m>-values are inputs, and <m>y</m>-values are outputs. If we change this equation to <me>y = f(x)+10</me> then we are really just adding the number <m>10</m> to all of the outputs for the original function <m>f</m>.</p>

        <p>In this section, we will see the effects of changing the input or the output of a function, particularly as relates to the graph. We will follow a single story that will lead us through most of the main points of this section.</p>

        <p>Confirm that this formula really works by graphing it on your calculator.</p>

        <p>It may have surprised you to see that shifting the graph to the <em>right</em> corresponded to <em>subtracting</em> a number from the input. To make sense of this, consider one of the other swimmers in the competition who jumped when the whistle sounded. Their height function would be given by <m>h = f(t)</m>.</p>

        <p>If we wanted to find our swimmer's height at, say, <m>3</m> seconds after the whistle sounded, it would be the same height as this other swimmer had at only <m>1</m> second after the whistle <mdash /> everything for our swimmer happened <m>2</m> seconds late. In other words, to find our swimmer's height after <m>t</m> seconds, this is the same as the other swimmer had <m>2</m> seconds before. So for our swimmer, her height is given by: <me>h = f(t - 2)</me></p>

        <p>The next two exercises will complete our story about the swimmer. In them, you will write formulas for her height given different diving situations.</p>

                <statement>
                    <p>The equation of a line with slope <m>m</m>, passing through the origin, is just: <me>y = mx</me></p>
                    <p>If we wanted to change this line so it had the same slope but passed through the point <m>(a,b)</m>, what would be the equation?</p>
                    <p><var name="$equation" form="popup" /></p>
                    <p>This is a very useful formula for writing the equation of a line if you know the slope and any single point on its graph. This formula is called the <term>Point-Slope</term> formula for a line.</p>
                </statement>
                <solution>
                    <p>The equation is <me>y = m(x-a) + b</me> no matter the sign (+ or -) on the values <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.</p>
