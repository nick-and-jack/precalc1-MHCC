        <p>The <term>composition</term> of functions is really about using the <em>output</em> of one function as the <em>input</em> for another.</p>
        <p>The notation we will use for composing two functions is <me>f(g(x))</me> which we read as "<m>f</m> of <m>g</m> of <m>x</m>".</p>
        <p>Working from the inside-out, this means that the function <m>g</m> is used first to get an output, and then that output is used as the <em>input</em> for the function <m>f</m>.</p>

        <exercise xml:id="exercise-composition-numbers">
          <statement>
            <p>Suppose <m>f(x) = 3x + 4</m> and <m>g(x) = x^2 + x</m>. Compute each of the following compositions:</p>

        <p>If we use function composition with a numerical input, we will get a numerical answer. However, if we just use <m>x</m> as the input and compose functions, the result will be an expression involving <m>x</m>, which is a brand new function representing the composition.</p>
        <p>This new function is called a <term>composite</term> function.</p>

        <exercise xml:id="exercise-composition-formulas">
          <statement>
            <p>Again, let <m>f(x) = 3x + 4</m> and <m>g(x) = x^2 + x</m>. This time, find the composite functions by using <m>x</m> as the input.</p>

          <hint><p>Remember to simplify the expression inside the parentheses first.</p></hint>
          <answer>
            <p>We must first substitute the expression for <m>g(x)</m> inside the parentheses, and then use that expression as the input for <m>f</m>.</p><md>

          </answer>
          <answer>
            <p>We must first substitute the expression for <m>f(x)</m> inside the parentheses, and then use that expression as the input for <m>g</m>.</p><md>
            <mrow>g(f(x)) \amp= g(3x + 4)</mrow>

            <mrow>\amp= 9x^2 + 27x + 20</mrow></md>
          </answer>
        </exercise>

          <p>Notice something important about the formula you found for <m>g(f(x))</m> in example <xref ref="exercise-composition-formulas" /> above: Using <m>x</m> as the input, you found that <m>g(f(x)) = 9x^2 + 27x + 20</m>. Evaluating this new formula at the input <m>x = 5</m> gives: <md>
          <mrow>9(5)^2 + 27(5) + 20 \amp= 9\cdot25 + 27\cdot5 + 20</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp= 225 + 135 + 20</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp= 380</mrow></md></p>
          <p>This is exactly the same result you got when you evaluated <m>g(f(5))</m> in example <xref ref="exercise-composition-numbers" />.</p>
          <p>The formula <m>g(f(x)) = 9x^2 + 27x + 20</m> is really a new, single function that represents the composition <m>f(g(x))</m>. Once you've found this formula, you could quickly evaluate many numerical compositions, such as <m>f(g(7))</m> or <m>f(g(-3.6))</m>, without having to think about <m>g</m> and <m>f</m> separately.</p>
          <p>Turning two or more functions into one function by composition is really a common idea &#8212; think about any complex machine, such as an automobile. Many internal processes depend on each other, and you may think of the following simplifications:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Applying pressure to the accelerator pedal allows air into the fuel system.</li>
            <li>The air in the system is monitored, and fuel is added to the system accordingly.</li>
            <li>Spark plugs ignite the fuel mixture.</li>
            <li>Etc.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Now, few people would look at a car and see it as a composition of its dozens of connected systems and processes. We just simplify this by assigning a single word to refer to this complex composite function: "car"</p>
          <p>If everything is working properly, from the driver's perspective, there is just one input &#8212; depressing the accelerator &#8212; that sets everything else in motion.</p>

          <p>The next example uses function composition in the context of a patient taking blood pressure medicine.</p>
          <example xml:id="example-composition-blood-pressure">
            <p>Let <m>C</m> represent the concentration, measured in mg/kg, of a blood pressure regulating drug in a patient's bloodstream as a function of time <m>t</m>, measured in hours. As time goes on, the concentration of the drug in the bloodstream decreases as the body metabolizes and/or excretes it.</p>
            <p>At the same time, the drug is meant to help lower the patient's blood pressure <m>P</m>, measured in mm Hg. So, as the drug leaves the patient's bloodstream, the blood pressure increases.</p>
            <p>Therefore, <m>P</m> depends on <m>C</m>, and <m>C</m> depends on <m>t</m>.</p>
            <p>There is a function which represents how <m>C</m> depends on <m>t</m>. We will call this function <m>f</m>, and write <m>C = f(t)</m>.</p>
<todo>Write a few teaser questions here.</todo>

            <p>There is another function which represents how <m>P</m> depends on <m>C</m>. We will call this function <m>g</m>, and write <m>P = g(C)</m>.</p>
            <p>So, we would first use <m>f(t)</m> to find the concentration <m>C</m> of the drug in the bloodstream, and then use that concentration as the input for the function <m>g(C)</m> in order to find the patient's blood pressure <m>P</m>.</p>
            <p>In function notation, this would look like:<md>
              <mrow>P \amp= g(C)</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp=g(f(t))</mrow></md></p>
            <p>That last expression, <m>g(f(t))</m>, is a <term>composite function</term>, and it shows that the blood pressure is really a function of <m>t</m>.</p>
          </example>
          <p>Continue example <xref ref="example-composition-blood-pressure" /> in the next exercise, evaluating the composition with a numerical input.</p>

                  <p>Therefore, the concentration can be modeled by the function <me>C = f(t) = 5e^{-0.058t}</me> where <m>t</m> represents the number of hours after it was consumed.</p>
                  <p>Suppose that a patient with hypertension is admitted with blood pressure at 160 mm Hg.

        <title>Summary of Inverses</title>
        <p>Two functions are called <term>inverses</term> if they <em>undo</em> each other. If one function has a certain process, then the other function will have the reverse process.</p>
        <p>This means that if <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are inverses, then both of the following will be true: <md>
        <mrow>f(g(x)) \amp= x</mrow>
        <mrow>g(f(x)) \amp= x</mrow></md></p>
        <p>This is because whatever the inside function did with the input <m>x</m>, the outside function <em>undid</em> that action.</p>
        <p>If a function <m>f</m> has an inverse function <m>f^{-1}</m>, then we say that the function <m>f</m> is <term>invertible</term>.</p>
        <example>
          <p>The functions <m>f(x) = 2^x + 1</m> and <m>g(x) = log_{2}(x - 1)</m> are inverses.</p>
          <p>In order to show this, we would use function composition to show that both of the conditions above are true.</p>
          <md><mrow>f(g(x)) \amp= f(log_{2}(x - 1))</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp= 2^{\displaystyle{log_{2}(x - 1)}} + 1</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp= (x - 1) + 1</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp= x</mrow></md>
          <p>This shows that <m>f(g(x)) = x</m>. Similarly, we have:<md>
            <mrow>g(f(x)) \amp= g(2^x+1)</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp= log_{2}\left((2^x+1)-1\right)</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp= log_{2}\left(2^x\right)</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp= x</mrow></md></p>
          <p>This shows that <m>g(f(x)) = x</m>.</p>
        </example>

        <paragraphs>
          <title>Notation</title>
          <p>If <m>h(x)</m> is a function, then its inverse is called <m>h^{-1}</m>. This notation does <em xml:id="note-about-inverse-exponent">not</em> mean that <m>h</m> is being raised to a negative exponent &#8212; rather, it is just special notation for an inverse function.</p>
          <p>We use this special notation either when we want to talk about the inverse of some function, or when we want to find the formula for the inverse.</p>
        </paragraphs>

        <paragraphs>
          <title>Interpreting the notation</title>
          <p>If <m>f</m> takes an input <m>a</m> and gives an output <m>b</m>, then its inverse <m>f^{-1}</m> would take <m>b</m> as the input and give the output <m>a</m>.</p>
          <p>Since a function and its inverse represent reverse processes, the input and output are similarly reversed.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <p>In the next two exercises, practice interpreting the meaning of an inverse function.</p>

          <p>If you have the graph of a function <m>y = f(x)</m>, you can sketch a graph of its inverse <m>y = f^{-1}(x)</m> by selecting points on <m>y = f(x)</m> and reflecting them over the line <m>y = x</m>. This is actually the effect of switching the <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-coordinates of a point: it reflects the point over the line <m>y = x</m>.</p>
          <paragraphs><title>The Inverse Formula</title></paragraphs>
          <p>If we have the formula for a function <m>f(x)</m>, we may want to use the formula for the inverse <m>f^{-1}(x)</m>.</p>
          <p>But how can we find the formula?</p>
          <example xml:id="example-inverse-balance-number">

              <p>If you deposit &#36;<m>500</m> into a savings account that earns <m>3</m>&#37; interest per year, and you make no additional deposits or withdrawals, then your account balance can be found by the function <me>B(t) = 500\left(1.03\right)^t</me> where <m>t</m> represents the number of years after making the original deposit of &#36;<m>500</m>, and <m>B(t)</m> represents the balance in the account after <m>t</m> years.</p>
              <p>For this function, the input is <em>years</em> and the output is <em>dollars</em>. You would use a number of years, say <m>12</m>, and the function <m>B(t)</m> would calculate how many dollars are in the account.</p>
              <p>The inverse function <m>B^{-1}</m> would switch these, using <em>dollars</em> for the input and <em>years</em> for the output. Here, you would use an amount of money, say &#36;<m>925</m>, and the inverse function <m>B^{-1}</m> would calculate how many years it would take.</p>
              <p>In order to find the value of <m>B^{-1}(925)</m>, we could solve for <m>t</m> in the equation: <me>500*1.03^t = 925</me></p>
              <p>Solve this equation to find the value of <m>B^{-1}(925)</m>.</p>

          <paragraphs><title>What makes a function invertible</title></paragraphs>
          <p>Remember the defining characteristic of a function:</p>
          <blockquote>For each input, there is only one output.</blockquote>
          <p>From a graphical standpoint, this means that there can be only one point with any given <m>x</m>-coordinate. No two points on the graph of a function can be directly above or below each other.</p>
          <p>Now, if an inverse <m>f^{-1}</m> is <em>really</em> a function, then it must also obey this rule. No two points on the graph of <m>y = f^{-1}(x)</m> can sit directly above or below each other.</p>
          <p>So if <m>f^{-1}</m> is a function, this has an implication for the original function <m>f</m>.</p>
          <p>To see this, let's use our rule about reflecting over the line <m>y = x</m>. If no two points on the graph of an inverse function can sit <em>above</em> or <em>below</em> each other, then reflecting these points over <m>y = x</m> means that no two points on the graph of <m>f(x)</m> can sit directly <em>left</em> or <em>right</em> of each other.</p>

            <li>
              <title>Vertical Line Test</title>
              <p>A vertical line may only intersect the graph of a function at most once. If some vertical line could intersect the graph more than once, then the graph is not a function.</p>

            <li>
              <title>Horizontal Line Test</title>
              <p>If a function is invertible, then its graph may only intersect a horizontal line at most once. If a horizontal line could intersect the graph more than once, then the graph will not have an inverse function.</p>

          <example>
            <p>As an example of using the <em>Horizontal Line Test</em>, the function <m>f(x) = x^2</m> does <em>not</em> have an inverse function, since the horizontal line <m>y = 4</m> intersects the graph of <m>f(x)</m> twice, at the points <m>(2, 4)</m> and <m>(-2, 4)</m>.</p>
