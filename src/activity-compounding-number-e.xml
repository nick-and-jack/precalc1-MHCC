  <title>Introducing the number e, Continous Compounding Activity</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>A car travels from Portland, OR to Seattle, WA (up to about <m>200</m> miles) in the span of <m>4</m> hours.  This is an average speed of <m>200/4 \approx 50</m> miles per hour. </p> 

    <p>We can use this information to write equations for the distance, D miles, from Portland as functions of time, t hours, in two different ways:</p>
    <p><m>D = 200/4 \cdot  t</m> or <m>D = 50\cdot t</m></p>
    <p>Some may argue these are the same formula. But are they?</p>
    <p>The first equation states <m>200</m> miles were covered in the span of <m>4</m> hours.  This is something that actually happened. It’s in the data.</p>
    <p>The second equation states <m>50</m> miles were covered in <m>1</m> hour. We don’t know if this actually happened, it’s just an average rate of change.</p>
    <p>Both equations will give us the same results, but each one tells a different story.</p>
    <p>In the activity, <em>Introduction to Exponential Functions</em> we learned to calculate the per unit growth factor using an overall percent change between two values.</p>
    <p>In this activity we first explore the meaning of exponential notation in the context of some real situations and see how it can help us comunicate our observations. Later we expand on this knowledge to build a new form of the exponential function called the <q>continuous</q> model.</p>
    <example>
      <p><q>A <m>20 \%</m> increase in the span of <m>5</m> years</q>, means the annual, <em>per year</em> growth factor <q>b</q> has been compounded <m>5</m> times for an overall <m>20 \%</m> increase (multiple of <m>1.2</m>)</p>
      <p>Therefore, 
      <md>
        <mrow>b^{5} \amp= 1.2</mrow>
        <mrow>b \amp= 1.2^{1/5}</mrow>
        <mrow>b \amp= 1.0371</mrow>
      </md>
      which represents an average increase of approximately a <m>3.71 \%</m> per year.</p>
    </example>
    <p>There is a difference between an obeservation and a calculation.  In the previous example, there really was a <m>20 \%</m> increase and it actually occurred over <m>5</m> years.  The value of <m>3.71 \%</m> annual increase is something we calculated with the given data which is an average annual percent growth.</p>
  </introduction>

  <subsection>
    <title>Interpreting the Exponential Form</title>
    <p>Earlier we learned that exponents <q>count</q> how many times the growth factor is repeated.</p>
    <example>
      <p>The expression <me>296(1.013)^{5}</me> states that an initial amount of <m>296</m> is increased by <m>1.3 \%</m> compounded <m>5</m> times.</p>

    <example>
      <blockquote>A chemical biologist measures the breakdown of a pollutant in a lake. She calculates a <m>4 \%</m> decrease in the amount of pollutant from the <m>4890</m> ppm (parts per million) initially measured. The decrease occurs over a time span of <m>72</m> hours.</blockquote>
      <p>Without missing a beat, or the need for any algebra, the biologist can immediately write a simple exponential formula as a function of time to model what she just measured.</p>
      <p>Using the initial amount of pollutant and letting <m>t</m> represent the time in hours since her first measurement, she writes <me>P(t)=4890(0.96)^{\frac{t}{72}}</me></p>
      <p>The formula literally says, <q>An initial amount <m>4890</m> ppm of pollutant decreases by <m>4 \%</m> every <m>72</m> hours.</q></p>
      <p>Of course, she doesn't know if the breakdown is actually exponential, it's just an assumption. She could have assumed a linear breakdown of the pollutant in which the <m>4 \%</m> decrease of the initial amount is the same amount each hour. A linear formula would therefore be, <me>P(t)=4890-4890(0.4 \cdot t)</me></p>
      <p>Nobody knows what the correct formula should be. There are many possible formulas that could model the breakdown of the pollutant. But one model may predict past or future data better than others and knowing what model to choose and why is the reason the biologist gets paid the big bucks.</p>
    </example>
    <p>By developing the connection between our literal understanding of a situation and the math notation used to describe it we afford ourselves great flexibility in how we interpret and how we model <q>real-life</q> data.</p>
    <example>
      <p>A population of <m>300</m> bacteria doubles every <m>5</m> hours. Write an exponential formula for the population size as a function of time, <m>t</m> hours.</p>
      <p>We can write a formula by choosing an algebaic technique.</p>
      <p>Our formula will be something like <m>P(t)=300\cdot b^{t}</m> where <m>300</m> is the known initial population and <m>b</m> is the unkown, hourly growth factor.</p>
      <p>We know that in <m>5</m> hours the population will grow from <m>300</m> to <m>600</m>. Therefore,
        <md>
          <mrow>300*b^{5}=600</mrow>
          <mrow>b^{5}=\frac{600}{300}</mrow>
          <mrow>b^{5}=2</mrow>
          <mrow>b=2^{\frac{1}{5}}</mrow>
          <mrow>b \approx 1.1487</mrow>
        </md>
        so our formula is <m>P(t) \approx 300(1.1487)^{t}</m></p>
      <p>On the other hand, if you can <q>speak math</q>, you can write a formula in about two seconds <me>P(t)=300(2)^{\frac{t}{5}}</me></p>
      <p>The formula literally says, <q>Start with <m>300</m> and multiply by <m>2</m> every <m>5</m> hours.</q></p>
      <p>With some knowlege of the properties of exponents we see how the two formulas are actually the same</p>
      <p>
        <md>
        <mrow>300(2)^{\frac{t}{5}}</mrow>
        <mrow>=300(2^\frac{1}{5} )^{t}</mrow>
        <mrow>\approx 300(1.1487)^{t}</mrow>
      </md>
      </p>
      <p>Either way we arrive at an hourly percent increase of about <m>14.87 \%</m> per hour.</p>

    <p>We now turn our attention towards finance where there are some variations in how exponential growth is calculated. Why is finance different? Short answer: money.</p>
    <p>When it comes to money, everybody seems to want more and some people have figured out ways to make more money depending on how they word things or how they make their calcualtions.</p>
    <p>Keep in mind that financial formulas quickly get extremely complicated, so our examples are overly simple in order to make our point.</p>

        <statement>
          <p>Assuming nothing is paid back during the year, what is the size of the loan at the end of <m>1</m> year,  if interest is compounded annually (meaning calculated only once at the end of the year)?</p>

          <p>Now consider the <m>12 \%</m> interest split over <m>12</m> months so each month you only get a small piece of the <m>12 \%</m>. In fact, the loan is charged only <m>\frac{12 \%}{12}=1 \%</m> each month.</p>

          <p>The value of the loan after one year depends on how the bank compounds the <m>12 \%</m> interest throughout the year.</p>
          <p>How much more money does the bank make if they compound the <m>12 \%</m> interest monthly instead of annually?</p>

        </statement>
      </webwork>
    </exercise>
    <p>Is there a way for the bank to make even more money? The bank already made more money by dividing the interest into <m>12</m> pieces. What if the interest is divided into smaller pieces and compounded more often during the year?</p>

    </exercise>
    <p>The last exercise leaves the bank with some good news and some bad news. The good news is more money is made the more often they compound the <m>12 \%</m> interest during the year. The bad news is the increase in money made is shrinking.</p>
    <p>In changing the compounding from once a year to <m>12</m> times a year the bank increase the loan value by about <m>3042.43-3024= \,\$ 18.43 </m></p>
    <p>But in changing the compounding from daily to hourly there was only an increase of <m>3044.24-3044.18 = \,\$ 0.06</m> which is only <m>6</m> cents!</p>
    <p>We can extend what we concluded in the last exercise with a general form of an expression for compounded interest.<me>A_{0}(1+\frac{r}{n})^{nt}</me></p>
    <p>Here <m>A_{0}</m> is the initial amount or value, <m>r</m> is the decimal equivalent of the interest rate, <m>n</m> is the number of times the interest is compounded and <m>t</m> is the amount of time the initial amount is left to grow or decay (think stock values over time). </p>
    <p>You may already know where this is going. We have to ask, "What is the most amount of money that can be made?" The answer depends on how often the interest is compounded. So, the real question is, "What is the most compounding possible?"</p>
    <p>Let's think about that. Compounding the interest is the process of <q>chopping</q> up the interest percentage into pieces and calculating the increase or decrease for each piece until all the pieces are counted.</p>
    <p><term>Annual interest compounded <em>yearly</em></term><index><main>Annual interest compounded</main><sub>yearly</sub></index>: the interest is divided into <m>1</m> piece and <m>1</m> increase is counted</p>
    <p><term>Annual interest compounded <em>monthly</em></term><index><main>Annual interest compounded</main><sub>monthly</sub></index>: the interest is divided into <m>12</m> pieces and <m>12</m> increases are counted</p>
    <p><term>Annual interest compounded <m>daily</m></term><index><main>Annual interest compounded</main><sub>daily</sub></index>: the interest is divided into <m>365</m> pieces and <m>365</m> increases are counted</p>
    <p>What is the maximum number of times any number can be divide? Infinity!</p>
    <p>Infinite compounding is called <term>continuous compounding</term><index><main>conituous compounding</main></index>. It means the interest is being calculated at every moment in time. In fact, there is no time at which the interest is not being calculated.</p>
    <p>When contiuous compounding occurs, the formula general formula we came up with earlier <me>A_{0}(1+\frac{r}{n})^{nt}</me> changes form. It becomes <me>A_{0}e^{0.12t}</me></p>
    <p>Compounding interest <m>12</m> times each year is the same as compounding the interest every <m>\frac{1}{12}</m> of a year. It is referred to as <q>compounded monthly</q> because <m>\frac{1}{12}</m> of a year is <m>1</m> month.</p>
    <p>Therefore another way to write the same equation would be</p>
    <p><m>V(t) = 4280(1.0401)^{\frac{t}{1/12}}</m></p>
    <p>Which means the interest is calculated every <m>\frac{1}{12}</m> of a year, but no one would do this because it is silly looking.</p>
    <p>Instead we keep the exponent as <m>12t</m> which is the same as monthly and the equation is prettier.</p>
