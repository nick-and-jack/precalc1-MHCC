        <li>
          <p>
            Vertical Stretches and Compressions
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      In the first exercise below,
      you will encounter your first of many
      <em>WeBWorK</em> problems.

              Let <m>f(x) = x^2</m>.
              This problem involves <em>vertical</em>
              translations of the graph of <m>f</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              <var name="$ggb" data="pgml"/>
            </p>

            <p>
              The graph above shows the function
              <me>
                f(x) + k = x^2 + k
              </me>
              where <m>k</m> is a constant number.
            </p>

            <p>
              You can use the slider to change the value of <m>k</m>,
              and observe how the graph changes.
            </p>

            <p>
              <ol label="a">
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Change <m>k</m> so the function is <m>y = x^2 + 5</m>.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    How did this change the original graph?

                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>
                    Change <m>k</m> so the function is <m>y = x^2 - 3</m>.

                    How did this change the original graph?
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Answer:
                    <var name="$down" form="popup" />

    <p>
      Next, recall how a graph changes when we either
      <em>add</em> or <em>subtract</em>
      from the <em>input</em> of the function.
    </p>

    <exercise>
      <webwork>

          <pg-code>

          <statement>
            <p>
              Again, let <m>f(x) = x^2</m>.
              This problem involves both <em>vertical</em> and <em>horizontal</em>
              translations of the graph of <m>f</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              <var name="$ggb" data="pgml"/>
            </p>

            <p>
              The graph above shows the function
              <me>
                y = f(x + h) + k = (x + h)^2 + k
              </me>
              where <m>h</m> and <m>k</m> are constant numbers.
            </p>

            <p>
              You can use the sliders to change the values of <m>h</m> and <m>k</m>,
              and observe how the graph changes.
            </p>

            <p>
              <ol label="a">
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Change <m>h</m> so the function is <m>y = (x + 4)^2</m>.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    How did this change the original graph?
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Answer:
                    The graph of <m>y = x^2</m> moved <var name="$left4" form="popup" />
                  </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>
                    Change <m>h</m> and <m>k</m> so the function is <m>y = (x - 5)^2 - 4</m>.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    How did this change the original graph?
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Answer:
                    The graph of <m>y = x^2</m> moved <var name="$right5down4" form="popup" />
                  </p>

    <p>
      Finally, explore the effect of multiplying the <em>output</em>
      of a function by a constant number.

          </pg-code>
          <statement>
            <p>
              The graph below shows a function <m>y = af(x)</m>,
              where <m>a</m> is a constant number.
            </p>

            <p>
              <var name="$ggb" data="pgml"/>
            </p>

            <p>
              Use the slider to change the value of the constant <m>a</m>,
              and observe changes to the graph.
            </p>

            <p>
              Notice that <m>a</m> is being multiplied by the <em>output</em>
              of the function <m>f</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              <ol label="a">
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Change <m>a</m> to a number greater than <m>1</m>.
                    What happened to the graph?
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Answer:
                    The graph of <m>f</m> was vertically <var name="$stretched" form="popup" /> the <m>x</m><ndash /> axis.
                  </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>
                    Change <m>a</m> to a number between <m>0</m> and <m>1</m>.
                    What happened to the graph?
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Answer:
                    The graph of <m>f</m> was vertically <var name="$compressed" form="popup" /> <m>x</m><ndash /> axis.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ol>
            </p>

            <p>
              Next, the graph of a different function <m>y = af(x)</m> is shown.
            </p>

            <p>
              <var name="$ggb2" data="pgml"/>
            </p>

            <p>
              This time, you can change <m>a</m> to positive or negative values.
            </p>

            <p>
              <ol label="a">
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Change <m>a</m> to the value <m>-2</m>.
                    What happened to the graph?
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Answer:
                    The graph of <m>f</m> was vertically <var name="$stretched" form="popup" /> by a factor of <m>2</m>,
                    and it was reflected over the <var name="$xaxis" form="popup" />.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ol>
            </p>
          </statement>
      </webwork>
    </exercise>

    <p>
      Questions you should be able to answer:

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            In general, how does the graph change when you <em>add</em>
            a number to the <em>output</em> of a function?
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            In general, how does the graph change when you <em>subtract</em>
            a number from the <em>output</em> of a function?
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      Practice using these ideas in the next two exercises.
    </p>

    <exercise>
      <webwork>

          <pg-code>
            $gr=init_graph(-3,-3,3,3,

            <p>
              The graph above shows <m>f(x) = x^2</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              The next two graphs below are transformations of <m>f</m>.
              Determine how <m>f</m> was transformed,
              and write the formula for each graph.
            </p>

            <image pg-name="$gr1"/>

            <p>
              The formula is:
              <m>y = </m><var name="$grans1" width="15" />
            </p>

            <image pg-name="$gr2"/>

            <p>
              The formula is:
              <m>y = </m><var name="$grans2" width="15" />
            </p>
          </statement>
          <hint>
            <p>
              You must use the formula for <m>f</m> to write a transformation of the form <m>f(x+h)+k</m>,
              for appropriate numbers <m>h</m> and <m>k</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Remember that the inside change involves a horizontal shift,
              and an outside change involves a vertical shift.

              think about shifting that point to <m>(7,15)</m>.
              Remember that adding to the <em>input</em>
              will move the graph to the left,

  <subsection>
    <title>Horizontal Stretches/Compressions</title>
    <p>
      We have already seen that the graph of a function may be stretched or compressed <em>vertically</em>
      by multiplying the output of the function by a constant number <m>a</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            If <m>a&gt;1</m>, then graphing
            <m>y = af(x)</m> would be the result of stretching <m>y = f(x)</m> vertically,
            away from the <m>x</m><ndash />axis.
            All of the <m>y</m> values on the graph of <m>f(x)</m> would be multiplied by this number <m>a</m>,
            so they would now be larger in magnitude
            (either positive or negative).
            Thus, the points would be stretched <em>farther away</em>
            from the <m>x</m><ndash />axis.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            If <m>0&lt;a&lt;1</m>, then the graph of
            <m>y = af(x)</m> would be like compressing the graph of <m>y = f(x)</m> vertically,
            toward the <m>x</m><ndash />axis.
            All of the <m>y</m> values on the graph of <m>f(x)</m> would be multiplied by the number <m>a</m>,
            so they would become smaller in magnitude.
            Thus, the points would be compressed <em>toward</em>
            the <m>x</m><ndash />axis.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, we know that adding or subtracting a number from the input of a function will shift the graph either left or right.

      It may have surprised you to see that multiplying the input of a function by a number larger than <m>1</m> actually made the graph
      <em>compress</em> horizontally.

        <p>
          For any value of the input <m>x</m>,
          evaluating <m>f(2x)</m> means you're looking at the output of <m>f</m> farther down the table,
          where the input is <m>2x</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          So, when <m>x = 2</m>,
          the output of <m>f(2x)</m> is the same as <m>f(4) = 23</m>.

          [The function <m>f</m> is linear,
          and its pattern can be used to determine values of the table.]
        </p>
      </answer>
    </exercise>

    <p>
      Notice that the output values for <m>f(x)</m>,
      which occur later in the table,
      now happen earlier for the transformation <m>f(2x)</m>.
      This makes sense graphically,
      as the points at certain heights now occur earlier,
      at smaller <m>x</m><ndash />values for <m>f(2x)</m>.
    </p>

    <note xml:id="note-horizontal-stretch-compress">
      <p>
        It is useful to realize that a transformation like <m>f(0.25x)</m> may be written as:
        <me>
          f\left(\frac{x}{4}\right)
        </me>
        Any transformation of the type <m>f(ax)</m> may be rewritten as
        <m>f\left(\dfrac{x}{\sfrac{1}{a}}\right)</m>, where one of the numbers,
        <m>a</m> or <m>\frac{1}{a}</m>, is greater than <m>1</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Therefore, another way to remember what this type of transformation does is the following.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you rewrite the transformation so that <m>a&gt;1</m>, then:
        <dl>
          <li>
            <title><m>f(ax)</m></title>
            <p>
              Compresses the graph of <m>f</m> by a factor of <m>a</m>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <title></title>
            <p>
              <q>Multiplying the input variable by a number greater than <m>1</m> will compress the graph.</q>
            </p>

            <p>
              Example:
              <m>f(3x)</m> is only <m>1/3</m> as wide as <m>f(x)</m>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <title><m>f\big(\frac{x}{a}\big)</m></title>
            <p>
              Stretches the graph of <m>f</m> by a factor of <m>a</m>
            </p>

            <p>
              Example?
              <m>f\left(\frac{x}{4}\right)</m> is <m>4</m> times as wide as <m>f(x)</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </dl>
      </p>
    </note>

    <p>
      Often, we will want to horizontally stretch or compress a function by a certain factor.
      Or, if we already have a transformed function's graph,
      we may need to determine what the stretching/compressing factor was.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The graph at left shows <m>y = f(x)</m>.
          This graph was horizontally stretched to make the graph <m>y = f(ax)</m> at right.

            y = f\left(\frac{x}{2.5}\right)

              </p>

              <p>
                By what factor was it compressed toward the <m>y</m><ndash />axis?

            </hint>
            <solution>
              <p>
                The <m>x</m><ndash />coordinate of the point was multiplied by
                <m>\frac{5}{8} = 0.625</m> in order to make the compressed graph,
                so the formula is:
                <me>
                  g(x) = \frac{1}{0.625x}
                </me>

                Remember that horizontally compressing
                (or stretching)
                happens by multiplying
                (or dividing)
                the input <m>x</m> by a number.
              </p>
            </hint>
            <solution>
              <p>
                Since the graph is compressed to half its original width,
                we must <em>multiply</em> the input <m>x</m> by a number greater than <m>1</m> <mdash /> in this case,
                that number is <m>2</m>.
