                <li><p>Currently, a preview of the web version is available at <url href="http://www.greenprecalc.com/precalc1-MHCC/html/"/>. The web version offers full walk-through solutions to most exercises, as well as interactive elements and easier navigation than print versions.</p></li>
                <li><p>A PDF-for-print will be available in June 2017. This version is designed to be printed, not read on a screen. To save on printing expense, this version is mostly black-and-white.</p></li>

        <title>To the Student</title>

        <p>You may think of this text as a <q>workbook</q>. Each chapter begins with activity sets, meant to serve as an introduction to a topic, and your instructor may assign activities to be done out of class as homework. In this way, you will come to class, having already studied the basics of a new topic, and ready to build on that new knowledge.</p>
        <p>The activity sets are followed by a <q>gist</q> section. The gist assumes that you have completed the activities, and it provides a retelling of the basic concepts and techniques. This will be a good place for you to refer when studying the material for an exam or quiz.</p>
        <p>Instead of just <em>reading</em> example problems, you will get to explore new ideas by working along <em>with</em> the examples. Most problems in the book allow you to manipulate dynamic graphs and receive immediate feedback by submitting your answers through <webwork /> online.</p>
        <p>We wrote this text with students in mind. We know how busy the life of a student can be <mdash /> some working full-time jobs, some with children to care for, often while taking a full load of classes. We want this to be a safe learning space and reference that you can take anywhere you have an internet connection. Also, we are releasing this for free, to help lessen the cost of higher education.</p>
        <p>We hope you find learning with this book to be an enjoyable and engaging experience!</p>

        <title>To the Instructor</title>
        <paragraphs>
        <p>This book is a collection of activities, a digital workbook, that replaces traditional textbook reading with an interactive, guided-lesson approach to learning. The workbook covers common topics of precalculus that are otherwise delivered as passive reading assignments or lectures.</p>
        <p>We hope this book will feel very natural to use. Each chapter begins with <em>activities</em> which introduce students to the basics of a topic. Activities can be assigned, graded and recorded through the use of <webwork />, an open-source online homework system. Many exercises include dynamic <url href="http://geogebra.org">GeoGebra</url> graphs for students to manipulate.</p>
        <p>These activities mimic what has traditionally been done in discovery-based classroom work, to be completed by students as <q>homework</q>. Having completed the activities, students come to class ready to engage in further discussion and application of the material. Since <webwork /> gives students immediate feedback, they get basic questions answered as they <em>actively read</em>.</p>
        <p>Following the activities, each chapter has a <q>gist</q> section which resembles the expository content in a traditional textbook, though it still has interactive components such as found in the activities.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs><title>Why Another Math Book</title>
        <p>Many mathematics textbooks begin with the assertion that they deliver a <em>new</em> or <em>unique</em> approach to learning. This book is different, at least in that regard, in that the authors concede there is really nothing new in our approach. What follows is a presentation of learning that happens in mathematics classrooms all over the world <mdash /> students actively engaged in the learning process: experimenting, observing, discovering and applying.</p>
        <p>Current technology in education software is used mostly in the assessment of homework. On the other hand, reading material in the form of an e-book is relatively static <mdash /> it is an electronic version of the text that remains a passive reading experience for the student.
          The result is students often skip the reading altogether and go directly to the homework section where they hope to learn their skills through repetition or by <q>reverse engineering</q> of the solutions.
          While homework remains a key aspect in student learning, it is currently used at the <q>back end</q> of the learning process. Research shows that an active, discovery-based approach in knowledge development, the <q>front end</q> of learning, contributes to longer knowledge retention and is linked to a deeper understanding of the material.</p>
        <p>Therefore with this book, we hope that the active learning process used so well in college classrooms can be brought to the <em>reading</em> experience. This is nothing new to mathematics, though perhaps it is somewhat new to the textbook.</p>
